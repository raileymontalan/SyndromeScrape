                        <p>In partnership with the Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, and the Ateneo de Manila University, FASSSTER aims to provide a user-friendly tool for modeling disease spreads in the Philippines to aid in the DOH&#39;s disease surveillance efforts. FASSSTER takes a multi-dimensional approach in modeling disease spreads by using localized indices from Philippine health records and by integrating third-party data, such as those found in Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems and online sources.</p>
                        <h4>Measles</h4>
                        <p>The Measles model follows one of the most basic compartmental model, the SEIR model (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered). The model does not show a move from the recovered population to the susceptible population because immunity is acquired by infectious individuals once they recover.</p>
                        <h4>Dengue</h4>
                        <p>The Dengue model follows the basic SEIR(S) compartmental model, emphasizing on the transition from recovered population to the susceptible population to take into consideration the susceptibility of a recovered patient to the other dengue serotypes. The described model follows a host-only model, which means that only the human population is included in the model. This is in contrast with a host-vector model where both the human and mosquito population are modeled.</p>
                        <h4>Typhoid Fever</h4>
                        <p>The Typhoid Fever model follows the basic SEIR(S) compartmental model, but to further encapsulate the nature of the said disease, a new compartment for the chronic carrier population was incorporated into the model to emphasize the impact that the 3-5% carrier population impose to the susceptible individuals. Given this, two new parameters were added into the model: transmission rate of carriers and the infectious to carrier progression rate. The transmission rate for carriers pertains to the rate at which carriers transmit the disease. On the other hand, infectious to carrier progression rate pertains to the rate at which the infectious population moves to the carrier population. Including a carrier compartment aims to improve the complexity of model to further capture the true nature of Typhoid Fever without disregarding the need for the model to capture the general behavior of the disease.</p>
