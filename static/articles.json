        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Manny Pacquiao, according to his adviser Mike Koncz, must make sure he doesn’t overtrain for his anticipated ring return in July. Pacquiao wants to train two-and-a-half months for the fight against WBA welterweight champion Lucas Matthysse. That’s 10 weeks on the calendar. Koncz, however, has reminded the 39-year-old Pacquiao not to overdo things in training. “We learned from the Oscar dela Hoya fight when Manny trained for 10 weeks and he burned himself out,” said Koncz. Pacquiao, the Canadian adviser remembered, got bored during camp in the United States for the Dela Hoya fight in 2008 that he sneaked out. “He returned to Manila (for a couple of days) without telling anybody,” Koncz said. He said seven to eight weeks of serious training, for his age, should be enough to get him in top shape. Pacquiao must also cut down on the miles and the number of rounds in the gym. “I want to see him start training next week but because he’s older now he’s got to go slower and take it easy and so he doesn’t get injured. “He has to pace a lot better than before,” Koncz added. Pacquiao and Matthysse are done with the press tour, a short one that had stops in Manila and soccer-crazy Kuala Lumpur. Matthysse was scheduled to fly back to the United States last night, and should prepare to begin training in Indio, California. The Kuala Lumpur stop was a hit, and Pacquiao capped his visit with a quick stop at the Rolex dealership at the KL International Airport. He left the store with an all-diamond Rolex Presidential.

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Top-ranked La Salle took its familiar spot in the UAAP women’s volleyball finals after dispatching No. 4 National U in yesterday’s Final Four at the MOA Arena, 27-25, 25-22, 25-11, clinching its 10th consecutive appearance in the Last Dance. The three-peat-seeking Lady Spikers patiently chipped away hot-starting NU’s lead in the first set to draw first blood then asserted themselves in the next two frames to seal the deal and set up an interesting title showdown with host Far Eastern U. The No. 2 Lady Tams had taken care of business by nosing out No. 3 Ateneo, 25-20, 25-21, 14-25, 25-19, in the semis faceoff last Saturday. This will be the first championship duel between DLSU and FEU since Season 71, when the Taft-based squad rallied from a 0-1 deficit to beat its opponent from Morayta in three games. Kim Kiana Dy dropped 17 points while Tin Tiamzon added 11 and Dawn Macandili had 23 excellent digs and 10 excellent receptions as DLSU extended its long-standing UAAP finals streak.  “Kung ano man ang narating namin, dahil yan sa players, ginusto nila ito. Nung first round may two losses, nag-bounce back, na-develop yung character ng team, yung maturity dumating sa players. Although may times nag-struggle, na-overcome naman nila  (This is all the fruit of the players’ desire and hard work. After two losses in the eliminations, they bounced back, developed their character and showed maturity. Although there are times of struggle they managed to overcome it),” said DLSU coach Ramil de Jesus. The Lady Bulldogs seized a 12-7 margin in the opening frame and got on the hill first on a back-row attack by Jaja Santiago, 24-23. But the Lady Spikers saved match point and outdueled NU towards the finish, breaking a 25-25 standoff on Majoy Baron’s hit and Des Cheng’s ace.  “Sabi ko sa players, huwag nating bigyan ng chance na makakuha ng kumpyansa ang NU; once makuha nila yung first set, medyo mahirap yung pagdadaanan natin. Medyo malayo yung first set, ginapang ng team hanggang abutan sa end game (I told the players not to allow NU to gain confidence by taking the first set, if they do, our road will get bumpier. They grinded it out until we caught up in the endgame),” said De Jesus. “After noon, medyo bumitaw unti-unti ang NU (After we took the first, NU gradually lost confidence),” he added. Jaja Santiago scored 17 hits on her final game, ending her UAAP stint without a championship. In the men’s division, Bryan Bagunas sizzled with a career-high 29 as No.1 NU Bulldogs overpowered No. 4 Santo Tomas, 25-13, 25-13, 31-29, to reach the finals for the sixth consecutive season. The Bulldogs imposed their will on the hapless Tigers on every aspect, posting 12 more spikes with their 39, eight more blocks with their 12 and four more aces with their six, to grab the first finals berth. NU awaits the winner of the other F4 duel between No. 2 FEU and No. 3 Ateneo. The Eagles leaned on Marck Espejo’s record 55 points to win the first game, 18-25, 25-13, 24-26, 25-23, 15-9, and force a KO match on Wednesday.",

        "content": "DANAO, Cebu, Philippines — Bradley Weiss and Carina Wasle bucked the odds, including the punishing terrain in the mountain bike part, the excruciating heat in the trail run and the tough field to reign as XTERRA Danao champions the second time around here yesterday. Weiss rallied from third in the opening swim stage by topping the bike part then the South African ace sustained his charge in the closing run leg to retain the crown in the men’s pro division of the second of three XTERRA series slated here. He timed 02:16:28 with clockings of 0:19:09 (swim), 1:15:35 (bike) and 0:40:04 (run). New Zealand’s Sam Osborne, who came in second to Aussie Ben Allen in the swim leg, struggled a bit in the bike part, enabling Weiss to seize control.  The Kiwi settled for another runner-up finish  in 02:17:17 in the premier endurance race billed as the Asia Pacific Championship and produced and organized by Sunrise Events, Inc. SEI actually modified the course setup in the bike (28K) and run (8K) parts with the 1.5K swim leg proving tougher with the strong current. “The course last year suits me up a little bit more but I prefer this race because it is hard and intense and the gaps are short among racers, making it more exciting for us as well as for the spectators,” said Weiss, who beat Osborne by almost seven minutes in last year’s XTERRA edition set over 1.5K swim, 40K mountain bike and 10K trail run. The weather was so searing that Weiss had wanted to wrap it all up as fast as he could. “It was so hot I just wanted it to be over,” added Weiss after successfully defending his crown, actually his third straight counting his 2016 feat in Albay. Another Kiwi, Kiera McPherson, finished strong in the run leg in 0:38:28 to claim third place in 02:19:47 as Allen hobbled in the bike and run stages and wound up fourth in 02:23:48. Wasle of Austria, who dominated her side last year by almost 30 minutes, also kept the women’s tiara in 02:49:38 (00:21:43/01:35:40/00:49:53), banking on a strong performance in the bike stage to edge Aussie Penny Slater (02:52:38).",

        "timestamp": "April 23, 2018",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Nonito Donaire Jr. staged a bold assault in the homestretch but failed to overcome Carl Frampton who held on to win the interim WBO featherweight crown via a unanimous 12-round decision at the jam-packed SSE Arena in Belfast, Northern Ireland, last Saturday night (yesterday morning, Manila). It was a masterful performance by Frampton who turned the tables on Donaire with a strategic adjustment in distance and space. After Donaire took the first round using heavy body shots to anchor an aggressive start, Frampton regrouped to exasperate the Filipino Flash with in-and-out tactics. Frampton used side-to-side movement to create angles for his blows then darted in to push Donaire along the ropes to take away his distance. He later credited chief cornerman Jaime Moore for the pivotal tweak. Things began to crumble for Donaire as early as in the second round when a vicious Frampton right hook left an ugly swelling under his left eye. Donaire, probably prompted by the damage, went for broke impatiently and tried to land one big punch but Frampton wouldn’t allow a standing target. The advantage that Donaire had in the first round went down the drain as Frampton took control of the ring with a brilliant display of boxing skills. Donaire pursued Frampton and looked to counter when the Irish engaged but couldn’t connect consistently as he slowed down from the chase.  When pinned along the ropes, Donaire fought back furiously but couldn’t sustain the pace that Frampton set. In the sixth round, Frampton threw down Donaire and English referee Marcus McDonnell ruled a slip. Even as Donaire seemed bigger than Frampton, the Irishman fought a more physical fight. In the seventh, Donaire turned away from Frampton after a headbutt opened a cut over his right eye but McDonnell waved them on. Donaire wobbled Frampton with a solid right during a fierce exchange near the end of the round. Frampton continued to score with his left jab in the eighth round as Donaire appeared to lose more steam. The hometowner pushed forward in the ninth with Donaire looking tired and slow-footed. It was the same pattern in the 10th as Donaire, abandoning his jab, waited for an opening to crack a homerun. Frampton knew what Donaire had in mind and kept a safe distance away, moving laterally. Before the 11th, Donaire’s wife Rachel – who worked his corner with conditioning coach Mike Bazzel and former world champion Clarence (Bones) Adams –tried to wake up her faltering husband with an expletive. It worked. Donaire, buoyed by a second wind, came out for the 11th bombing and a left hook clearly staggered Frampton who once again threw down the Filipino to stymie his attack.  Donaire desperately went for the sleeper in the 12th but Frampton stayed out of striking distance. Then, with 20 seconds left, Frampton stood his ground and blasted Donaire with a flurry to close the bout in a flourish.  Frampton deserved the verdict. Judges Steve Wade of England, Patrick Morley of Chicago and Zoltan Enyedi of Hungary turned in identical 117-111 scorecards, giving Donaire only three rounds. The Star had it 116-112 for Frampton.  After the fight, Donaire went to social media and said he will move back to the superbantamweight division for his next fight, indicating he’s far from finished. He called Frampton an amazing fighter, smart and tough. His wife also took to social media to apologize for her language in the corner and to congratulate Frampton. “This experience, even though it sucks to lose, let’s be honest, it’s a telling story that we don’t belong in the featherweight division,” she said. “It’s better to realize now than getting hurt.”",

        "content": "NEW ORLEANS – Anthony Davis sat on the court, a scowl on his face and his biceps flexed on each side of his head. The Pelicans All-Star had just converted a layup as he fell to the court after a hard foul. His strength-projecting celebration afterward was that of a franchise player determined to lay the foundation of his playoff legacy with a dominant performance in the clutch. “In a close-out game and then the magnitude of the situation, this is probably the best game he’s played since I’ve been here,” Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. “He just was not going to let us lose.” Davis scored 33 of his franchise playoff-record 47 points in the second half – including 12 points in the final five minutes – and New Orleans completed a first-round playoff sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers with a 131-123 victory on Saturday night. And when Davis wasn’t devastating the Blazers, Jrue Holiday was giving Portland fits with explosive drives or pull-up jumpers. Holiday capped his 41-point night with an 18-footer that gave the Pelicans a six-point lead with 40 seconds left. In Minneapolis, Jimmy Butler hit four 3-pointers among his 28 points and Karl-Anthony Towns snapped back from a bad start to the series with 18 points and 16 rebounds, leading the Timberwolves past the Rockets, 121-105, in Game 3 for their first postseason victory in 14 years. Jeff Teague scored 23 points and Andrew Wiggins pitched in 20 points with another four 3-pointers, helping the Timberwolves match the NBA’s best 3-point shooting team with 15 makes apiece from long range. Minnesota took 27; Houston launched 41. In Miami, Ben Simmons became the first rookie since Magic Johnson in 1980 to have a playoff triple-double, JJ Redick led Philadelphia with 24 points and the 76ers moved one win from the second round by topping the Miami Heat, 106-102, to take a 3-1 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round series. In Salt Lake City, Ricky Rubio had 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for Utah’s first playoff triple-double in 17 years, and Donovan Mitchell added 22 points to lead the Jazz to a 115-102 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder and a 2-1 lead in their first-round series. Joe Ingles, who had 21 points, made two three-pointers around two free throws to spark a 13-0 surge that ended on Mitchell’s triple to put Utah up by 20 points in the fourth quarter.      ",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Kia Picanto came back from a forgettable conference bearing a new name – Columbian Dyip – and a new game attitude, pulling off a surprising 126-98 rout of Blackwater at the start of the PBA Commissioner’s Cup at the Smart Araneta Coliseum last night. Fil-Am backcourt players Jerramy King and Rashawn McCarthy provided tremendous boost, combining for seven three-pointers and a whopping total of 52 points as Columbian made an auspicious second-conference start coming from a mere one-win showing in the all-Filipino tourney. “More than anything else, it’s the change of attitude of our players. That’s one change that is welcome,” said Columbian coach Ricky Dandan. “That’s something we talked about. After our last game in the Philippine Cup, we took a break just for two weeks and returned to training camp. We talked about changing our attitude – the players not playing the same way they did in the all-Filipino and me not coaching the same way I coached,” Dandan added. With a positive outlook, the Dyip five upended the Blackwater team that performed a lot better in the Philippine Cup. And curiously, Columbian blew past Blackwater despite a mere nine-point game from import Charles Aiken. Later in the night, TNT KaTropa’s old hands sizzled with 15-of-30 three-pointers to highlight an explosive game as the Texters withstood the GlobalPort Batang Pier, 128-114, in a highly emotional, physical game marred by numerous technical and flagrant infractions. Terrence Romeo struggled with a bad shooting in his TNT debut but had his clutch shots in their fourth-quarter rampage on the way to the 14-point victory.

        "content": "VIGAN, Ilocos Sur, Philippines — The national track and field association yesterday said it will not recognize the three new national junior records posted in the just-concluded Palarong Pambansa here after the organizing Department of Education failed to have the games sanctioned by the governing local track body. “Unfortunately, it is not possible,” a source from the Philippine Amateur Track and Field Association (PATAFA) told The STAR. “DepEd did not seek PATAFA’s sanction of the competition.” Without the PATAFA expertise, some events in track and field encountered problems. Hurdler Eliza Cuyom and sprinter Veruel Verdadero of Calabarzon and javelin thrower Ann Katherine Quitoy of Western Visayas shattered the current national juniors marks currently listed in the PATAFA records. Already in the age of modern digital technology, Palaro still used hand timers and only used equipment to measure wind gauge in the jumping events and not in sprints where Cuyom and Verdadero ripped the national juniors’ marks in 100m hurdles and century dash, respectively. The games also saw Bicol’s Lheslie de Lima run an extra 400m on her way to winning the girls 3000m gold right on the first day. “The track events are even more problematic since most timers who officiated were not PATAFA-accredited technical officials,” the same source said. Cuyom, 17, turned in a blistering 14.50-second effort, besting the 14.73 she set in the trials that erased the national juniors’ hand-timed record of 15-sec. flat which Julie Rose Forbes posted in the National Open in Manila 18 years ago.",

Missing out on the UAAP women’s volleyball finals for the first time in seven years, the Lady Eagles face a rebuilding process for Season 81 with coach Tai Bundit and top scorer Jho Maraguinot declaring their departure and key players Maddie Madayag and Bea de Leon undecided yet on returning. “End of contract,” Bundit, who led AdMU to two titles, told reporters after Ateneo bombed out of the championship picture following a 20-21, 21-25, 25-14, 19-25 setback to No. 2 FEU. Maraguinot said she wil opt out of her final year of eligibility. “I think I’m done,” she said. Both Madayag and De Leon were non-committal in coming back. “Maybe,” Madayag responded to queries. “It’s a possibility but I don’t want to make any rash decisions,” said De Leon. Despite the earlier-than-usual exit, the Lady Eagles said reaching the semifinals this campaign was an achievement in itself, given the circumstances. “We did good already. Top 3, we had new setter, new libero but we go to Final Four. Very good for me already,” said Bundit. “Masasabi naman siguro na lumaban kami pero mas gusto lang ng FEU (we gave it a good fight but FEU just wanted it more) and I guess it’s a factor na maraming first time na babad sa game (we had so many players who just got playing time this year) and it’s a very young team,” said Madayag.  “Disappointing loss but what we’ve accomplished is not disappointing because we made it this far as a team – kapos sa spiker, sobrang bago lang liberos (notwithstanding the lack of spikers and the inexperience of liberos),” the Ateneo skipper added.",

Exie Biteng scored on a broken play while Eric Jabel hit two free throws as the Cardinals weathered the Maroons endgame fightback to launch their campaign in Group A. The Muralla-based looked headed for a cruise after Lawrence Victoria came away with a floater for a 75-67 lead with 63 seconds left in the contest. But the Maroons, with Juan Gomez De Liaño burying back-to-back triples, pulled to within two, only to be stopped on their tracks by Biteng and Jabel. Akhuetie scored on a three-point play with no time left to close out the scoring as UP slid to 0-2 following a 76-82 defeat to La Salle in Saturday’s opener. Biteng and Jabel scored 19 and 13 points, respectively, while Victoria added 12 markers for the Cardinals. Mapua led for majority of the contest and like the Archers, the Cardinals clamped down on Akhuetie in defense, throwing him single, double, and at times a triple coverage. Still, the former Perpetual Help Nigerian center finished with 30 points and 18 rebounds while Paul Desiderio added 13 markers and de Liaño chipped in 12 points. Later in the day, the Tamaraws dominated early, 49-24, but the Chiefs recovered and rallied to within, 59-64, with five minutes left in the match. But Hubert Cani drained in a triple to frustrate the Chiefs. Cani led FEU with 15 points while Richard Escoto and Brandey Bienes scored 10 markers apiece.

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte has set a 60-day timeframe for the peace talks he is seeking to revive with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), urging its leaders to accept the new negotiations he has offered. “Take advantage of that 60 days. If it succeeds, I would like to thank God first, and the Filipino people and the military and the police for their understanding,” Duterte said in a speech at a motorcycle clubs’ convention in Legazpi City, Albay on Saturday. But the President did not say when the 60-day period would start. He also wants the  CPP’s armed wing the New People’s Army (NPA) to lay down its arms during the negotiations – a condition that the rebels are likely to reject. Duterte reiterated his invitation to exiled CPP founder Jose Maria Sison to come home to hammer out a deal. “I am talking to Sison now. It is an off-and-on thing and propably the military and the police have misgivings,” Duterte said. He stressed that he is neither a soldier nor a policeman, and his “fundamental” duty as President “is to see to it that my country is peaceful.” “Just recently I created a small window of 60-day proposal to Jose Maria Sison. I need not go there, but I invite you to come here and I will answer your traveling (expenses) including fare, billeting and food,” Duterte said. Sison has been in exile in the Netherlands since his release from prison in the late 1980s. Duterte promised the safety of NPA members during the new negotiations. “Those members of the guerrilla fronts can designate a place where you can keep your firearms and inform us where they are and you are free to go anywhere you want without carrying arms,” the President said. “I will give you complete freedom to move. I will not harass anyone and I will order the military and the police to be nice to you,” he added. The communist insurgency has raged for half a century and killed more than 40,000 people. On-off negotiations to end the revolt have been brokered by Norway since 1986. In February, a Norwegian diplomat met Duterte to try to persuade him to restart the negotiations that Duterte had scrapped in anger over what he considered the duplicity of the communists. Earlier this month, Duterte ordered his Cabinet to work on a truce to enable talks, but the communist rebels have rejected any preconditions. Ending the conflict was among Duterte’s priorities when he took office in 2016. But he abandoned peace efforts in November, infuriated by repeated NPA’s attacks during the talks. In early April, Duterte said the rebels must agree to a ceasefire, stop extortion activities and abandon their proposal of a coalition government, before resuming talks. – With Celso Amo, Reuters",

        "timestamp": "April 23, 2018",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The latest annual US Country Report on Human Rights and President Donald Trump’s engagement with leaders who have been questioned for their human rights record, including President Duterte, are “complementary” and not two things in “conflict.” “Does that mean that (Trump) should never speak to these people? We’re trying to keep the report as the factual baseline for what we’re going to do in policy terms or sanctions as the (Secretary of State) was mentioning. So we can learn a lot from this, and we can use it to formulate a policy,” said Ambassador Michael Kozak of the US State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. “But usually part of your policy is engaging with the people whose behavior you’re trying to change at some level. I don’t think those two things are in distinction,” added Kozak.  He said the report is an assessment of human rights situations in countries, including the Philippines and China, and the responsibility of the government for the abuses that occur.  “We’re not just saying there are these societal problems in the country; we’re saying the government either has done these bad deeds or not,” he claimed. In its report on the Philippines, the State Department noted that extrajudicial killings (EJKs) “have been the chief human rights concern in the country after a sharp rise with the onset of the anti-illegal drugs campaign in 2016, that continued in 2017.” For his part, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said last Saturday that the government’s vigorous campaign against crime, most especially against the illegal drug trade, seeks to promote the welfare and protect the human rights of all Filipinos – to save lives, preserve families, protect communities and stop the country from sliding into a narco-state. The Duterte administration therefore should squarely address serious concerns by the international community on the drug-related EJKs in the country by soberly presenting facts instead of lashing out, Sen. Panfilo Lacson said yesterday. Lacson, who chairs the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, stressed that diplomacy and dialogue will go a long way in setting the record straight on the administration’s controversial and bloody campaign against illegal drugs, which reportedly has claimed the lives of over 10,000 people since 2016. He said Malacañang should exert efforts to inform the European Union parliament and the US State Department – both of which have repeatedly expressed grave concern over EJKs – of the administration’s side, particularly the casualties security forces have sustained. “The best antidote to such criticisms is to throw back facts. Instead of saying ‘we don’t care,’ let productive people in the intelligence community analyze (the EU and US reports) and correct them through communications,” Lacson told dzBB. “Our communication – not only in the country but also outside – should be improved and that can’t be done by cursing or criticizing. When you criticize, were you able to correct any misimpression?” he said. He appealed to the media to also report the strides of the government against illegal drugs as well as the numerous casualties sustained by the police in the campaign. Lacson said the international community is greatly influenced by what the local media reports in forming their stand on the administration’s war on illegal drugs. The senator added that Malacañang should also concede some of the criticisms on EJKs have basis even as he stressed there remains a need to review anti-drug operations. He said the police officers handling drug cases should not be lazy or frustrated if the suspects they prosecute are set free either by corruption or poor evidence gathering. “Nothing beats hard work, good intelligence and patience,” Lacson said. – With Paolo Romero",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos should brace for even hotter weather this week due to the ridge of high-pressure area, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) warned yesterday. The weather system, which is associated with good and sunny weather, will start affecting Northern Luzon, particularly the cities of Tuguegarao in the next few days, PAGASA weather specialist Ariel Rojas said. Rojas said the temperature in Tuguegarao hit a sweltering 37.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday. PAGASA said the ridge of high pressure is expected to affect Northern and Central Luzon today and tomorrow, causing warm and dry condition over these areas with possible isolated rain showers. Metro Manila and the rest of the country will be partly cloudy to cloudy with chances of rain showers or thunderstorms. Easterlies will continue to prevail over the country by Wednesday until Friday, bringing partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers over the entire archipelago. PAGASA said no tropical cyclone is expected to form or enter the Philippine area of responsibility until Friday. Meanwhile, temperatures in the next days would range from 24 to 34 degrees Celsius in Metro Manila, 25 to 32 degrees Celsius in Cebu province, and 24 to 33 degrees Celsius in Davao region, Rojas said. In Metro Manila, the hottest temperature so far this year was recorded on April 13 at 35 degrees Celsius. PAGASA officially declared the start of the dry or summer season in the country on April 10. The Philippines normally experiences the warmest temperatures in May, according to PAGASA. The hottest weather on record is 42.2 degrees Celsius, which was registered on May 11, 1969 in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, it said.  ",

        "timestamp": "April 23, 2018",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Kuwait has summoned Philippine Ambassador Renato Pedro Villa for his alleged “inflammatory comments” against the Arab state and for perceived misconduct in the rescue of distressed Filipino workers by Philippine diplomatic staff. Villa was summoned on Saturday for the supposed “inappropriate behavior” of Philippine diplomatic staff, who were seen in a viral video rescuing Filipino workers, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported yesterday. The Philippine rapid response team on Thursday located abused Filipino domestic helpers who had requested to be rescued. In the video, the embassy staff were seen whisking an abused Filipina domestic helper away from her employer. Villa also supposedly made offensive comments against Kuwait in a newspaper article. The government of Kuwait has served protest notes to Villa and summoned him. KUNA reported that a spokesperson for the Kuwait Interior Ministry said the protest notes were “related to recent remarks by several Filipino officials which amounted to serious offences against the State of Kuwait and led to the actions of some embassy employees in violation of the diplomatic norms governing relations between the two countries as per the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.” In a separate statement, the Kuwait Interior Ministry also expressed “grave concern” over the viral video and warned that “the full force of the law will be brought to bear on those complicit in the wrongdoing.” Member of the parliament Askar Al-Enezi said the situation has exceeded the limits of diplomatic tact and reached the point of interference in the affairs of the country. “It is unreasonable that a team from the Philippine embassy roams the streets of Kuwait and ‘rescue’ individuals and take them to the embassy under the pretext the maid has been assaulted by the sponsor. This is a violation of our sovereignty,” he added. Villa said the Philippine embassy would answer Kuwait’s protest. In a statement yesterday, ACTS-OFW party-list Rep. Aniceto Bertiz III stressed that the Philippine government is “duty-bound to safeguard” all Filipinos wherever they may be. “In extreme cases wherein Filipino domestic workers are being physically battered or sexually abused, and cry out for help, our embassy is expected to take appropriate action,” he added. Bertiz is in Kuwait to facilitate the repatriation of undocumented Filipino workers who obtained amnesty from the government of Kuwait. Bertiz also warned the government of Kuwait against expelling Villa “If they throw out our ambassador, it will not be left unanswered by the Philippine government. There will surely be tit-for-tat,” he said. “We understand that several members of parliament in Kuwait have demanded that the Philippine ambassador be kicked out over the incident portrayed in the video. This is totally uncalled for,” he added. Meanwhile, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) has given assurance that it has sufficient funds to provide cash assistance to returning workers from Kuwait. OWWA chief Hans Cacdac said for this year, the board has approved a P500-million standby fund for crisis-related repatriation, including the amnesty repatriation in Kuwait. “So there is no problem in cash assistance in case there is unpredictable number of availeess or returnees from Kuwait,” he added. Cacdac said thousands of Filipino workers are still expected to return home even after the amnesty for undocumented workers in Kuwait ended yesterday. The Philippine government is also establishing additional shelters to accommodate workers seeking repatriation. – With Delon Porcalla, Mayen Jaymalin",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Insurance Commission (IC) has warned the public and its regulated entities against cryptocurrencies, citing the risks involved in using these digital assets. In an advisory posted in the IC website, commissioner Dennis Funa said the public should be prudent when dealing with cryptocurrencies as these can be used in many illegal activities and are not suitable investment instruments. “While recognizing the value of technological advancement on the use of cryptocurrencies, the IC likewise recognizes the corresponding risks involved in (their use),” Funa said. “The apparent increase in the demand for cryptocurrencies and their popularity in terms of usage as a medium for payment and remittances worldwide makes (them) prone to being used for facilitating illegal activities, such as scams, money laundering, and terrorism financing,” he added. “Thus, the public is being cautioned to act prudently whenever dealing in the acquisition, possession, and/or trading of cryptocurrencies,” Funa concluded. Considering that cryptocurrencies are neither issued nor guaranteed by any government, Funa said their value is dependent on market demand and supply, which makes them highly speculative and not suitable for investment.     “Individuals with dealings on cryptocurrencies are highly encouraged to educate themselves on the matter and be updated on the various rules and regulations issued by different government agencies, such as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),” Funa said. The insurance chief cited BSP Circular 944 issued in February last year, which requires any entity that offers services or engages in activities that provide facility for the conversion or exchange of fiat of currency to virtual currencies, or vice versa, to register with the BSP as a remittance and transfer company. “Notwithstanding this regulation, the BSP does not, in any way endorse virtual currencies as legal tender, store of value or an investment vehicle,” Funa clarified. The SEC, for its part, has also warned the public against internet-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency schemes. The regulator said these schemes are now becoming rampant, listing 14 entities engaged in such activities. Despite the caution, Funa said the IC will “keep an open mind” to the potential of cryptocurrencies in its regulated industries. “If and when warranted, we will issue appropriate regulations as far as the insurance, pre-need and (health maintenance organization) industries are concerned,” he said.",

        "timestamp": "April 23, 2018",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Ridesharing company Grab is set to reimpose its 2x maximum surge charge today.  This comes as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) allowed Grab to reimpose the 2x surge cap for its trips following the accreditation of new Transport Network Companies (TNCs). In an order signed last Thursday, the LTFRB lifted the 1.5x cap on the surge charges or fees that can be imposed by the ridesharing company during peak hours when demand is higher than supply. The LTFRB last week approved the accreditation of three new TNCs, namely the GoLag Inc., taxi-hailing application Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc. and ridesharing company Hype Transport Systems Inc. The lower surge price was initially ordered by the board during a special hearing on Grab’s purchase of Uber earlier this month. Grab admitted that surge has been felt at longer times since Uber exited the country last Monday. Still, the company vowed to comply with LTFRB’s order to suspend the imposition of a P2 per minute charge pending review of its legality, which was questioned by a lawmaker.  Grab maintained that the charge was legal and for the benefit of their partner drivers.  Brian Cu, Grab country manager, said their bookings have seen a 70 percent increase but their supply of Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) partners have not kept up.  Cu said the number of their vehicles has only gone up by about 40 percent.  As this developed, Camarines Sur Rep. LRay Villafuerte maintained that there should be no monopoly in TNVS.  “(Grab’s) virtual monopoly quickly reared an ugly head in the form of these anti-competition practices of abrupt ride cancellations and prohibitive fare price surges,” Villafuerte pointed out.  “We cannot allow Grab to continue allowing its abusive driver-partners to operate, or to overcharge passengers just because we are left with no choice but to tolerate Grab’s virtual monopoly that has led to a fast deteriorating quality of service,” he said.  The administration lawmaker claimed he has repeatedly heard mounting “complaints from customers about exorbitant fares and the nasty practice of the company’s driver-partners of canceling rides or refusing bookings by passengers.”  Villafuerte said Grab customers also informed him that the company had taken out a link in its app that allowed them to contact Grab’s support via email to complain about drivers who abruptly cancel bookings. “I was told that these drivers cancel bookings without even the courtesy of informing them about the cancellation. Many of them have complained that they were made to wait for a long time by drivers, only to have their rides cancelled,” he revealed.  “This is highly unprofessional behavior that Grab should not tolerate,” Villafuerte said.  He said Grab should adopt the defunct Uber’s practice of using customer ratings of drivers to determine who should be prioritized in getting passenger bookings, suspending the abusive ones who cancel rides repeatedly or refuse to accept bookings.  Drivers should not find out the destinations of their booked rides until after they have picked up their passengers, he said. – With Delon Porcalla ",

        "timestamp": "April 23, 2018",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has called for an end to impunity in crimes against the environment and for Filipinos to fill the gap in law enforcement, especially those that relate to the protection of resources. In celebration of Earth Day, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu urged the public to stop tolerating environmental abuse and to instead take part in the strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. “The government needs the direct participation of the citizenry in accelerating reforestation, coastal cleanups, conserving energy and popularizing lifestyles that will enable the country to reduce its carbon footprint and enhance its resilience,” Cimatu said. “Environmental abuse persists because there are people who allow, if not encourage, irresponsibility to proceed with impunity,” he stressed. As a case in point, he cited the case of Boracay Island, which President Duterte ordered closed for rehabilitation. For more than a decade, he said, the DENR had been issuing warnings about the coliform contamination of the island’s waters, caused mainly by domestic and commercial wastes being discharged directly into the sea. “If we had been warning about Boracay for over a decade now, why were our warnings not heeded? If the Philippines has been celebrating Earth Day since 1990, why do the environmental problems plaguing Boracay and other areas persist?” Cimatu asked. To prevent further degradation and destruction, he gave assurance that the government would do everything it can to save the world-famous Boracay. “We will not stop until we make Boracay a livable community. We will make sure Boracay waters will pass the international water quality standards and that solid wastes are properly managed in the area,” Cimatu said. As the world marked Earth Day, presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said the President’s move to order an island closure and rehabilitation, which is to be implemented on April 26, is the government’s most evident contribution to saving the planet. “Today, April 22, we join the rest of the world in observing Earth Day. This year’s observance of Earth Day in the Philippines has stricken a resonant chord with the government’s resolve to clean and restore Boracay Island to its previous stature as one of the most beautiful and pristine beaches of the world,” Roque said. “This is a good wakeup call to everyone that we must not sacrifice the future ecological sustainability on the altar of economic growth and development,” he added. The Philippine National Police has sent more than 600 policemen to maintain peace and order during the six-month closure to tourism activities while the Armed Forces of the Philippines sent about 200 soldiers. Meanwhile, former president and now Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has called on the Filipino-Chinese business community to help the island recover economically after it is closed to the public. She said the Filipino-Chinese community should do its part in making sure the country keeps the momentum by inviting more Chinese tourists to the country despite the closure. Noting that over one million Chinese tourists came to the country last year, she added that she does not want the country to suffer the same fate as Phuket, Thailand, which was hit by a tsunami in 2004. “I mentioned about one million Chinese tourists suddenly coming when practically none in the previous administration and so many of them go to Boracay,” Arroyo said in addressing the conference of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FFCCCII) at the Century Park Hotel in Manila over the weekend.  Back then, she added, honeymooners who were supposed to go to Phuket went to Boracay and other parts of the Philippines “and stayed in the Philippines since then.” She stressed that the one million mark was reached only during Duterte’s administration, a sharp increase when compared to former president Benigno Aquino III’s “dismal number.”  Arroyo also wanted the Filipino-Chinese community to be active in making Chinese tourists feel at home while in the country “because they are familiar and comfortable with many Chinese customs and traditions.”   “I would want those Chinese tourists who know only Boracay to be able to go to other parts of the Philippines rather than go to Bali or Phuket. You, the Filipino Chinese members of the federation, in your own areas, I hope you would be able to bring them to other areas that are unknown to China, so we don’t lose them to Phuket and to Bali,” she said.  Arroyo also urged the FFCCCII to support her advocacy of sending young college students to China to enable them to get a better understanding of China and improve national ties.  She sought the group’s help in sponsoring a college student from every region of the country to go on a weeklong trip to China for them to learn from the “Chinese economic miracle.”  – With Christina Mendez, Paolo Romero, Delon Porcalla, Jennifer Rendon",

        "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — President Duterte has warned former labor undersecretary Dominador Say to shut up or he would make public a sworn statement detailing Say’s alleged corrupt activities in office. Duterte issued the warning in a speech at the 24th Annual Convention of the National Federation of Motorcycle Clubs of the Philippines in Legazpi City, Albay on Saturday. “You better shut up or tell the truth immediately. I have the affidavit on my desk and I could give it to the media. Then I would ask to endorse it to the ombudsman,” he said. Say resigned last week as labor undersecretary for policy, employment and regional operations. He said he was not doing enough to resolve the country’s contractualization dilemma. Duterte, however, was bent on firing Say even before then justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II resigned. Say was said to have long been in the list of officials the President wanted to kick out. “As the (labor) department official in charge of policy, I felt I was not doing well enough in order to articulate and blend the interests of both labor and management, and so the issue of contractualization could not see its fruitful conclusion,” Say was earlier quoted as saying. Duterte insisted that the case with Say should also serve as a warning to the corrupt in government. “If you do not call it a change, so be it. But I’m trying here to rid (government) of corrupt officials. That’s my warning,” Duterte said. The President has sacked several department heads as well as Cabinet officials involved in graft and corruption while in office. The President kicked out Philippine Maritime Industry Authority chief Marcial Amaro III, Dangerous Drugs Board chief Dionisio Santiago and Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno. Duterte also kicked out former information technology chief Rodolfo Salalima and former National Irrigation Authority chief Peter Laviña.",

        "timestamp": "April 23, 2018",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Education (DepEd) has welcomed a recent survey showing 24 percent of companies are ready to hire senior high school graduates this year. Education Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said the survey conducted by employment website JobStreet is a welcome opportunity for DepEd to have baseline data on employer’s willingness to hire K-12 graduates. “Twenty-four percent is about two in every 10 of company employers, a good enough percentage to take in K-12 graduates in entry level positions doing administrative and support work to technical, supervisory and managerial levels,” he said. “It is a challenge at the same time for K-12 graduates to develop their skills and be the company’s engine to growth. Coupled with the right attitude, they will surely succeed in the labor market,” he added. The survey conducted by JobStreet as part of its 2018 Fresh Graduate Report showed that only 24 percent of employers using the website are ready to hire the first batch of graduates of the K-12 program. It also revealed that 35 percent of employers on JobStreet are not ready to hire K-12 graduates, while 41 percent are still undecided. The lack of available positions for non-college graduates and the supposed insufficient work experience of K-12 graduates were the primary reasons cited by employers who said that they are not ready to accept senior high school graduates. Those who were undecided said that they are either evaluating the readiness of their companies or are still finalizing the timeline on when they would hire K-12 graduates. On Friday, business leaders called on companies to consider hiring senior high school graduates. “There really are jobs that do not need a full four-year degree to start with. Just because there’s surplus of college graduates does not justify discriminating against those who do not have a college degree,” Philippine Business for Education (PBEd) chairman Ramon del Rosario said.  “That’s the appeal we’re making — open our minds to the possibility that senior high school graduates do have enough competencies for certain jobs,” he added.  Del Rosario said there are certain specific jobs that can be filled by people who do not have college degrees, particularly those who have benefited from the senior high school curriculum.   “While it is still a work in progress, they do have the competencies for some jobs. All we’re saying is, do not discriminate against them,” he said. PBEd has initiated an affirmative hiring initiative for K-12 graduates to provide opportunities to as many as 600,000 senior high school graduates who may want to join the workforce. The program aims to enjoin companies to rethink their hiring policies by opening entry-level position for senior high school graduates. “Maybe it’s time for us as companies to do away with this age-old requirement which says you have to be a college graduate,” Del Rosario said. Meanwhile, the League of Filipino Students (LFS) has reiterated its criticism against the senior high school program, noting that it would produce contractual and more unemployed Filipinos. “Findings by various institutions and even government data have already proven that K-12 does not – and will not – work, nor does it solve problems besetting the country’s education system,” LFS spokesperson Kara Taggaoa said. “Its sole purpose is to ensure the steady supply of cheap and docile labor needed by imperialists and oligarchs. It also institutionalized commercialization in basic education by ensuring millions of pesos in profit for capitalist-educators as it makes education further inaccessible to a majority of the youth,” she added.",

An alleged NPA amazon was arrested after the encounter that occurred in Barangay Astorga in Sta. Cruz town, according to Maj. Ezra Balagtey, spokesperson for the Eastern Mindanao Command. The slain NPA leader was identified as Julito Pueblas, alias Taghoy, said to be the head of the Sentro de Grabidad of the NPA-Guerrilla Front 51. The unit was said to be operating in the towns of Sta. Cruz and Bansalan as well as in Digos City, all in Davao del Sur, and some parts of Toril district in Davao City. The name of the other fatality was not immediately available. The arrested female rebel was identified as Jessa Lumana. She was taken to a hospital for medical checkup before she was turned over to the local police. Pueblas and the guerrilla’s remains were turned over to the municipal social welfare office. Cpl. Kenneth James Balicot of the 2nd Scout Ranger Battalion was wounded in the firefight, Balatey said.  Security forces recovered from the site of the encounter an M16 rifle, four  improvised explosive devices, two rifle grenades, ammunition, two-way radios, seven backpacks, revolutionary flags, medical supplies and personal belongings.  The firefight broke out at around noon in Sitio Bayongon between the rebels and a joint team of the Army’s 39th Infantry Battalion (IB) and 2nd Scout Ranger Battalion.  Pueblas was severely wounded when found by pursuing troopers at around 5 p.m., of the same day. The soldiers treated Pueblas wounds but he died as he was being taken to a helicopter landing point.  Pueblas and his group were tagged in the ambush of a group of police officers in 2017 and of a government ambulance in 2014, both in Bansalan town. The military said Pueblas was also responsible for the killing of a certain Raul Alang in Sta. Cruz town in February this year. Meanwhile, an Army trooper was killed in another encounter in Mahaplag, Leyte on the same day. Authorities withheld the names of the slain trooper until after his family is notified. Reports said the troopers were conducting patrols in Sitio Canayan, Barangay San Juan when they encountered at least seven guerrillas.

Teodoro Baguilat Jr. due to the “inordinate delay” of the Office of the Ombudsman in investigating the case. In a resolution promulgated on April 19, the anti-graft court’s Fifth Division found merit In Baguilat’s motion to dismiss the charges, citing violation of his rights to a speedy resolution of the case. Filed by the ombudsman on Feb. 9 this year, the charges against Baguilat stemmed from the provincial government’s allegedly anomalous procurement of a vehicle when he was governor. The ombudsman said no public bidding was conducted for the project. It said the deed of sale for the project was prepared ahead of the purchase request, canvass report and purchase order, which allegedly made the transaction anomalous. Records showed that on May 19, 2004, the ombudsman received an anonymous letter detailing the alleged anomaly in the project of the provincial government. Citing the alleged anomaly, the provincial board filed a complaint against Baguilat before the ombudsman in 2009. The ombudsman issued a resolution in April last year, finding probable cause to charge Baguilat with violation of Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The Sandiganbayan said the ombudsman failed to justify why it took them more than 10 years to resolve the complaint.",

He replaced former LTFRB-Bicol director Jun Abrazaldo, who was removed over accusations of graft and corruption. Delgra said Abrazaldo’s removal stemmed from the allegedly anomalous transactions involving his office. Abrazaldo threatened to file a case of harassment against Delgra.

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Operatives of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) arrested a Chinese man for alleged possession of at least three kilos of shabu with an estimated street value of P15 million during a sting in Manila on Saturday night.  The arrest of Jason Chen, 37, alias Xu Qingchu, of Alonzo street in Sta. Cruz, came after months of surveillance, according to PDEA public information chief Derrick Arnold Carreon. The PDEA agents, backed by members of the Manila Police District drug enforcement unit, apprehended Chen at the corner of Plaza del Carmen and Roxas Boulevard at around 7:30 p.m. Aside from shabu, authorities said they recovered the marked money and a white Hyundai Tucson believed used by the suspect in his drug deals. Carreon said they were checking if Chen has links with suspected Chinese drug traffickers arrested recently by the PDEA in Malabon City and Batangas. Eight persons, including four Chinese, were nabbed when PDEA agents raided a drug laboratory in Batangas on April 12. The next day, anti-narcotics operatives busted a shabu facility in Malabon and arrested a Chinese and his Filipino driver.  PDEA chief Aaron Aquino said the Chinese were members of the Dragon Wu drug ring with links to the Golden Triangle operating at the borders of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. Chen is being held by police on charges of selling illegal drugs under Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.  Five other drug suspects were nabbed when police raided a house in Paco yesterday. Three of the suspects were identified as Jerald Mark Lara, Danilo Lara and Jesus Lara. Police said they recovered P60,000 worth of shabu and firearms during the operation. Senior Inspector Edwin Fuggan said they conducted the raid after receiving information that the Laras were allegedly into drug pushing. In Pasig, two drug suspects were collared in separate operations in Barangays Pineda and Pinagbuhatan. They were Joy Baderes and Ricky Retales. The suspects allegedly yielded six sachets of shabu and the marked money.  – With Romina Cabrera, Non Alquitran ",

        "content": "MANILA - A US State Department report citing concerns over \"police killings\" in the Philippines should be taken as constructive criticism, the Commission on Human Rights said Sunday. Speaking to ANC, lawyer Jacqueline de Guia, CHR spokesperson, said the agency hopes the government will see the US report as an opportunity to show the world that our criminal justice system works. \"There is a golden opportunity for the Philippine government to show that indeed our criminal justice system is working. It is important that we show our investigations are moving towards accountability,\" she said. \"It is important that charges are being filed regardless of whom have committed all these alleged human rights violations. And for the court, to show that indeed people will be held to account and due process is observed,\" she added. The US State Department's \"Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2017\" said \"killings by security forces\" were among the \"most significant\" human rights issues in the Philippines. \"The government investigated a limited number of reported human rights abuses, including abuses by its own forces, paramilitaries, and insurgent and terrorist groups,\" the annual report added. Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano maintained that the anti-narcotics campaign is \"guided by the rule of law embodied in our Constitution\" which upholds human rights. \"As a sovereign nation, the Philippines deserves the same kind of respect we have been extending to our friends in the international community,\" he said. The European Parliament also adopted a resolution last Thursday which \"condemns all extrajudicial killings and violence\" in the Philippines—a report that Cayetano also slammed. CHR's De Guia said the government shouldn't be surprised with the concerns voiced by other countries because human rights is an international concern.",

Usan Asani, former barangay captain of Camamburingan, and three other family members were killed in the incident. According to witnesses, the assailants targeted the residence of Asani, who has filed his candidacy for the upcoming barangay elections. Authorities immediately pursued the assailants, following leads from witnesses. Brigadier General Juvymax Uy said the attack appears to be isolated and may not be related to the Abu Sayaff Group. \"This attack is currently under investigation. So far, we have no indicators linking this to a terror attack,\" he adds. Later in the day, Hernie Asao, the incumbent barangay chairman of Camamburingan, appeared at the headquarters of the 18th Infantry Battalion in the same town. Confiscated from his possession was an M-16 rifle with M203 grenade launcher. Asao will be charged with violation of the election gun ban, and will be investigated in relation to the attack.",

Inilabas na nitong Biyernes, Abril 20, ang kautusan ng Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) na nagbabalik sa tinatawag na price surge ng Grab. Kamakailan, pinababaan ng LTFRB ang surge rate ng Grab habang wala pang ibang akreditadong TNC sa bansa. Mula sa dating times two o doble ng pasahe, iniatas ng LTFRB sa Grab na gawing \"times 1.5\" o isa't kalahati lang ang surge rates nito. Pero dahil, may iba nang akreditadong TNC o ride-sharing company, binawi na rin ang pagpigil sa surge rate ng Grab. Halimbawa, ang normal na pasahe ng Grab na P150 ay magiging P300 na tuwing rush hour.  Sa panayam ng DZMM, sinabi ni LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra na balik na ang times two price surge, pero tumangging banggitin kung kailan ito eksaktong magiging epektibo. \"Hindi ko alam kung bukas man lang, pero lumabas 'yong order last Friday... I don't want to say anything more than that because all the results are being reviewed,\" ani Delgra. Samantala, nananatili ang suspensiyon ng LTFRB sa ipinataw na P2 per minute charge ng Grab.  Hihintayin na lang ng LTFRB ang lalamanin ng motion for reconsideration o apela ng LTFRB ukol dito. -- Ulat ni Raya Capulong, ABS-CBN News",

He ordered visitors be kept away from April 26 so facilities to treat raw sewage can be set up and illegal structures torn down. \"This year’s observance of Earth Day in the Philippines has stricken a resonant chord with the government’s resolve to clean and restore Boracay Island to its previous stature as one of the most beautiful and pristine beaches of the world,\" Roque said in a statement.  \"This is a good wake-up call to everyone that we must not sacrifice the future ecological sustainability on the altar of economic growth and development,\" he added.  Boracay residents will be obliged to carry new identification cards and will be banned from boating and night swimming, he said. Entry to the 1,000-hectare island will be limited to a single small sea port. Businesses in the area, which previously lobbied for a phased rehabilitation, have warned that an abrupt shutdown could lead to bankruptcies and job losses for many of the island's 17,000 hotel, restaurant and other tourism workers, plus some 11,000 construction workers. The island drew 2 million visitors last year, earning the country more than a billion dollars in tourism revenue, according to official data.

The departments under the executive branch will continue to serve the nation and the best interest of our people by bringing comfortable life to disadvantaged and marginalized families, unmindful of the distraction and political noise,\" Roque said in a statement.  \"We shall therefore work double time in highlighting policies and programs of the current administration that have the most impact to the lives of our countrymen,\" he added.  The Cabinet's rating is the lowest it received since its moderate +22 rating in April 2016, SWS said.  Public satisfaction with the Supreme Court and the Senate also went down, but stayed the same for the House of Representatives, the pollster said. ",

Tinatayang nasa 1.8 milyon ang kakailanganing cyber security workers sa buong mundo hanggang taong 2022, ayon sa pag-aaral. \"The shortage of cyber security [workers] is not just a local problem. It's something na parang global concern because the threat landscape is always changing,\" ani Paul Oliveria, technology communications lead sa kompanyang Trend Micro. \"When we say shortage, we can look at it as either 'yong current staff nila doesn't have sufficient skills or wala pa rin talaga silang capacity to defend their networks or analyze these threats,\" paliwanag ni Oliveria.

        "content": "KUWAIT—The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here summoned Philippine Ambassador to Kuwait Renato Villa to hand him two diplomatic protest notes. A spokesperson at the ministry said the notes were “related to recent remarks by several Filipino officials which [amounted to] serious offences against the State of Kuwait and [led] to the actions some embassy employees in violation of the diplomatic norms governing relations between the two countries as per the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” the Kuwait News Agency reported.  The spokesperson “expressed regret over such practices which could harm the friendship between the two countries.” Villa said the Philippine Embassy will submit an official reply to the diplomatic protest notes to shed light on a video that allegedly shows embassy officials rescuing distressed Filipino household service workers from Kuwaiti homes. In a press briefing Saturday, Villa made some clarifications about a video that went viral on social media and carried by some news outfits that some embassy officials and personnel allegedly extracted distressed Filipino household service workers directly from Kuwaiti homes and took them using diplomatic vehicles. “I would like to acknowledge the support and cooperation of the government of the State of Kuwait in addressing our government’s concerns on the situation of our domestic workers. We thank the Kuwaiti government for the extension of the amnesty program for undocumented foreign nationals including Filipinos. As a result, we were able to bring home and reunite around 5,000 of our workers in the Philippines,\" he said. Villa denied the statement on Arabic dailies attributed to him saying that the Philippine Embassy does not need the help of Kuwaiti authorities in extending assistance to Filipinos in Kuwait. “I would like to underscore that all our efforts to assist our nationals here in Kuwait would not be possible without the support of the Kuwaiti government. I would like to assure that all actions taken by the embassy are all intended to support our collective efforts to find solutions to the problems we have encountered concerning our workers,” he explained. He stressed that the embassy always coordinates with the Ministry of Interior when responding to requests for assistance from its Filipino nationals. “This is standard procedure and we will continue to do so. All the efforts undertaken in the past weeks in response to request for assistance by our nationals are undertaken to ensure that we resolve outstanding issues before the signing of the labor agreement and the visit of President Duterte,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Lou Arriola announced during a meeting with the Filipino community on Friday that the embassy led by Villa is coordinating with Kuwaiti authorities for the preparation of the upcoming visit of President Rodrigo Duterte to Kuwait, which will likely happen after the Holy Month of Ramadan sometime in June. Arriola and her team arrived in Kuwait on Friday to oversee and assist the Philippine Embassy in the repatriation of undocumented overseas Filipino workers in Kuwait who received amnesty from the Kuwait government. There will be last two flights that will fly 340 undocumented Filipinos out of Kuwait as the amnesty ends on April 22.",

Out of the total 2,467 drug-related homicide incidents recorded, 1,752 are still under investigation, while 715 have been solved, police said. But the State Department noted that \"the reported number of alleged extrajudicial killings varied widely, as government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) used different definitions.\" Other human rights issues cited in the State Department's report were \"harsh prison conditions,\" and \"cases of apparent government disregard for legal rights and due process.\" In a statement, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano maintained that the anti-narcotics campaign is \"guided by the rule of law embodied in our Constitution, which also enshrines the country’s long-standing tradition of upholding human rights.\" \"We do not need others who think they know better than us Filipinos to tell us what to do.

Sa programang \"Usapang de Campanilla\" sa DZMM, tinalakay ang mga batas kaugnay sa pangangalaga ng kalikasan. Ayon kay Atty. Claire Castro, isa sa mga ito ang Republic Act 10176 o Arbor Day Act of 2012. Layon nitong himukin ang mga tao na magtanim ng puno kada taon. \"Ito lang 'yung batas na parang hindi nagagampanan o naipapatupad, pero obligasyon pala ng bawat mamamayan, 'yung mga physically-able, at the age of 12 pataas, eh dapat magtanim ng isang seedling ng puno kada taon,\" sabi ng abogado. Napapaloob ito sa Section 8 ng batas na nagsasabing: \"All able-bodied citizens of the Philippines, who are at least twelve (12) years of age, shall be required to plant one (1) tree every year.\" Inuutusan din ng batas ang mga lokal na pamahalaan na magsagawa ng Arbor Day o Tree Planting Day sa kanilang lugar. \"Sa pamamagitan kasi ng local government, simula sa barangay, sa munisipyo, sa city, sila 'yung dapat na nagpapasimuno, kasi sa bawat local, dapat magkaroon ng tinatawag nating Arbor Day, sila 'yung magde-declare kung anong araw,\" paliwanag ni Castro, Aniya, ang lokal na pamahalaan ang mamimili kung saan gaganapin ang pagtatanim ng puno. Bagama't walang nakasaad na parusa kapag hindi sumunod, hinihimok pa rin ni Castro ang mga tao na sundin ang batas. \"Obligasyon din naman natin, out of our own volition, puwede tayo magtanim kahit hindi Arbor Day,\" aniya. Pagkuha ng buhangin sa Boracay Samantala, may ordinansa naman sa Boracay na nagbabawal sa pagkuha sa sikat na buhangin ng isla. \"May ordinansa sa Boracay na hindi ka puwedeng kumuha ng buhangin, pag nahuli ka, meron kang magiging penalty, ang fine mo is P2,500 at puwede kang ma-imprison nang hindi hihigit sa 3 buwan sa unang offense,\" ayon kay Castro.

Sa Abril 26 o sa Huwebes sa susunod na linggo nakatakdang ipatupad ang closure order sa Boracay upang isailalim ito sa malawakang rehabilitasyon. Kaya naman enjoy muna ang mga turistang gaya ni Don Duria ng Quezon City, na kasama ang mga kaibigan upang makapag-relax sa maputing buhangin ng Boracay. \"Actually susulitin namin ito hanggang Monday. Kasi balik na rin kami ng trabaho eh,\" ani Duria.  Ang pamilya naman ni Bebie Bael na nag-tour sa Luzon ay dumaan pa ng Boracay bago umuwi ng Cebu sa Linggo. \"Ita-try namin 'yung mga activities tulad ng banana boat ride, saka nagpapa-braid na rin [ng buhok] para souvenir pa-picture,\" sabi ni Bael. Sa datos ng Caticlan Jetty Port, bumagsak ng 18 porsiyento ang bilang ng mga turistang dumating sa mga nalalabing araw bago isara ang Boracay. Nagsara na ngayong Sabado ang ilang maliliit na establisimyento tulad ng isang fast-food chain sa station 3. \"Uubusin na lang namin 'yung product tapos uwi na lang kami siguro,\" pahayag ng cashier na si Eugene Pagatpat. Bagsak-presyo na rin ang isang malaking souvenir shop sa Boracay. Ayon sa mga empleyado, habang may turista pa sa isla ay kailangang kumita muna sila. \"Nagbagsak kami ng presyo...Kasi pa-close na,\" ayon sa empleyado ng shop na si Liezel Oliveros. Mahigit 100 empleyado ng souvenir shop ang maaapektuhan ng closure. Pero bibigyan naman umano sila ng kanilang amo ng pansamantalang trabaho gaya ng paglilinis sa beach. Sa kabuuan, nasa 36,000 daw ang mga trabahador na maaapektuhan ng closure, ayon sa mga stakeholders.  --Ulat ni Nony Basco, ABS-CBN News\n ",

Karaniwan na ginagamit ng mga turista ang mga van dito bilang uri ng transportasyon papunta at paalis ng Busuanga Airport. Ayon kay Coron Mayor Jericho Barracoso, 2 sasakyan ng lokal na pamahalaan ang pansamantalang ginagamit para maihatid ang mga turista. Paglilinaw din ni Barracoso, tanging ang mga van na pagmamay-ari ng mga hotel ang papayagang magsakay ng turista.  Dagdag pa niya, may mga tricycle naman umano na maaaring gamitin bilang uri ng transportasyon ngunit hindi maaaring bumiyahe ang mga ito sa national road papuntang airport. Nakikiusap naman ang mga driver at operators ng van rentals na asikasuhin na ng lokal na pamahalaan ang pakikipag-usap sa Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board para sa aplikasyon ng prangkisa. Inamin naman ni Barracoso na ilang taon na umanong nagpapasa ng aplikasyon ang mga operators pero hindi pa umano nagbibigay ng prangkisa ang LTFRB sa Coron.  Sinubukan kunin ng ABS-CBN News ng pahayag ang LTFRB tungkol dito ngunit hindi pa ito sumasagot sa paanyaya. -ulat ni Tina Marasigan, ABS-CBN News",

Ayon sa kapatid ni Martin, mabigat at halos hindi nito mabuhat ang kaniyang bagahe noong ibinigay niya sa airport sa Texas ngunit gumaan at may tatlong butas na ito pagdating sa Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3. \"Humingi kami ng assistance sa security kaso hindi kami tinuro where to complain,\" ani Martin.  Dahil pagod na sa 18 oras na flight, umalis na lang ng airport at dumiretso ng Pangasinan ang magkapatid. Pero hindi makalimutan ng pamilya ang sama ng loob na dinulot ng insidente.  \"President [Rodrigo] Duterte ang kapatid ko naghirap sa ibang bansa para sa aming family tapos ganun nanakawin lang...Sana po magawan niyo ng aksiyon ang mga nasa terminal na 'yan. Sana masugpo na kasi nakakasira sa ating imahe sa ating bansa,\" hinaing ni Martin.  Idinulog ng Tapat Na Po kay Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager Ed Monreal ang insidente.\n    \nUna, nilinaw ni Monreal na hindi naman dapat awtomatikong isisi sa kanila ang nabutas na bagahe dahil puwede rin namang sa Amerika o sa Japan ito ginawa. Dapat din daw ay agad-agad nagreklamo sa airline ang pasahero. \"Meron pong representative ang mga airline sa arrival area tuwing flight nila...Meron pong lost and found staff nila na mag-aasikaso sa kanila,\" giit ni Monreal. Ipinakita rin ni Monreal ang proseso ng pag-unload ng mga bagahe hanggang ilagay ito sa conveyor para kuhanin ng pasahero.\n    \nMay guwardya rin daw ang airline na hindi tauhan ng airport na nakatokang magbantay sa kanilang bagahe. \"Ang nangyayari ngayon, sa dami ng nagrereklamo, ang turo agad sa Pilipinas. Ako Pilipino, nasasaktan po ako. Sa tagal ko sa airport alam ko po ang proseso sa bagahe,\" hinaing ni Monreal. Naghain na ng reklamo sa ANA ang kapatid ni Martin. Ipatitingin rin sa kanila ang CCTV sa Lunes para makita ang pag-handle ng bagahe pagdating ng eroplano sa NAIA.\n    \nAabangan ng Tapat Na Po ang magiging pag-usad ng reklamo.

        "content": " Dumalo sa isang pasayaw sa bayan ng San Fabian, Pangasinan ang magkakapatid na sina alyas “Lorna,” “Jimmy” at “Lolita” noong gabi ng Marso 6, 2016. Sina Lorna at Jimmy, nakauwi na sa kanilang bahay pasado alas-4 ng umaga, ngunit hindi na nila kasama ang isa pang kapatid.  “Pagkadilat ko, nandiyan na pala sila, pero nagulat din ako nung pagkakita ko, bakit dalawa na lang 'yung umuwi kong anak,” kuwento ni alyas “Ligaya,” ina ng tatlong magkakapatid. Hindi nakauwi ang 14 taong gulang na si Lolita kaya nagtulong-tulong ang pamilya sa paghahanap sa kaniya. Ani Ligaya, hindi normal para sa dalaga ang umalis ng bahay nang walang paalam. Maliban kasi sa pagiging katuwang sa gawaing-bahay, masipag rin daw ang dalagita sa pag-aaral. “Kapag nandito siya sa bahay, lahat ng gawain sa bahay hangga’t kaya niya ginagawa niya. Paglalaba, paglilinis, pagluluto o kung may gawain na kaya niya, tumutulong siya,” pag-alala ng ina. Noong sumunod na umaga, nagtungo ang asawa ni Ligaya na si alyas “Loreto” sa kanilang taniman. Sa hindi inaasahang pagkakataon, natagpuan niya ang anak na si Lolita na nakabigti sa isang puno ng mangga. “Pagpunta ko doon, lumakad ako dahil 'yung kalabaw ko nasa kabila, nandiyan na 'yung anak ko, nakabitay na,” ani Loreto. Naging pala-isipan para sa pamilya ang nangyari sa masipag na dalagita. “Nung una pa lang hindi na sila (Jimmy at Lorna) naniwala talaga na nagbigti, kaya sila ang unang nagsabi na ipa-autopsy na lang natin para alam natin kung ano talaga ang ikinamatay ng kapatid namin,” kuwento ni Ligaya. Base sa post-mortem examination, natukoy na asphyxia by strangulation ang ikinamatay ng biktima. “Base po sa autopsy po natin, lumalabas na hindi hanging kung hindi strangulation ang ikinamatay ni Lolita,” ayon kay Special Investigator 3 Giomenes Norlo Gallang ng National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) sa Dagupan.

Aside from Duterte, Abram's other godfathers are Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Special Assistant to the President Bong Go, Presidential Adviser for Sports Dennis Uy, and Office of Civil Defense Administrator Ricardo Jalad. Faeldon resigned as Customs chief last year after senators criticized him for the entry of billions-worth of illegal drugs under his watch. In December, Faeldon, who was still in detention, was appointed by Duterte to the Office of Civil Defense. He was transferred to the Pasay City Jail in January after bickering with Senator Richard Gordon during a Senate inquiry. Faeldon was eventually released in March.",

Thanks!) pic.twitter.com/Dr6BNEVeC1  Ayon sa Comelec, dahil ito sa mababang bilang ng mga nais kumandidato sa parehong eleksiyon. \"Initial reports from our field officials confirm not only the low turnout of candidates for the SK Elections but also to the Barangay Elections,\" ayon sa resolusyon. Nakatakda ang extension sa Sabado, mula alas-8 ng umaga hanggang alas-5 ng hapon.  Biyernes sana magtatapos ang paghahain ng COC pero kahit hindi pa nailalabas ang anunsiyong extension, tila matumal at hindi gaanong dagsa ang tao sa mga opisina ng Comelec.

[Persida] Acosta's actions are clearly unbecoming of a public official and their counterproductive effects are prejudicial to the best interests of the service,\" matapang na sagot ni Duque sa isang press conference isang araw matapos ang paghahain ng kaso.  Ang kaso ay isinampa ng PAO nitong Huwebes kaugnay sa pagkamatay ni Abbie Hedia, isang batang nabakunahan ng Dengvaxia noong panahon na nakaupo na si Duque bilang kalihim ng Department of Health (DOH).  \"Dapat po pala hinold na ni Duque para hindi na na-inject-an ang anak ko, pero pinagpatuloy niya kaya dapat siyang kasuhan din,\" ani Ruby Hedia, ina ni Abie.  \"Nakakalungkot na pag-upo po ni Duque sa halip na ipatigil niya ay tumuloy pa rin ang pagbabakuna, at meron na pong limang namatay sa pagpapatuloy ng kaniyang pagpapabakuna,\" paliwanag naman ni Acosta.  Pero ayon kay Duque, wala siyang kinalaman sa implementasyon at pagpapatuloy ng dengue immunization program, at mayroon siyang mga dokumentong magpapatunay nito. \"I have nothing to do with it, kasi bago lang ako, dumating ako [sa DOH] November 7, 2017. Eh 'yung kawawang bata naturukan daw November 17, so 10 days...Wala akong kaalam-alam,\" paliwanag ni Duque. Hindi rin niya isinasantabi ang posibleng pagsasampa ng libel laban sa PAO. Ipinagtataka naman ni Duque kung bakit hindi kinasuhan ng PAO ang naunang DOH secretary na si Paulyn Ubial, gayong siya ang nagpalawig pa ng pagtuturok ng Dengvaxia.  \"I think she's equally liable because she continued it despite [knowing] the red flags, she knew there were risks...Nung na-implead ako, and not Ubial, 'yun ang malaking question mark and I find that malicious,\" sabi ni Duque.  Sabi naman ng PAO, balak nilang kuhanin si Ubial bilang state witness. \"Si Ubial po nagpahayag sa amin ng willingness na maging state witness kaya hindi po siya kasali sa demanda. Nakita po namin ang kaniyang good faith,\" paliwanag ni Acosta.  Nanindigan naman ang DOH na hindi muna nila gagamitin ang Dengvaxia sa bansa. Revoked na din ang certificate of product registration ng bakuna sa ngayon.  --Ulat ni Kori Quintos, ABS-CBN News",

        "content": "Kamakailan ay naglabas ng desisyon ang Korte Suprema na nagsasabing labag sa Saligang Batas ang watchlist order na inilabas noon ng Department of Justice (DOJ) laban kay dating Pangulong Gloria Arroyo at sa kaniyang asawa na si Mike Arroyo. Noong 2011 inilabas ang watchlist order ni dating Justice Secretary Leila de Lima. Layon nitong mapigilan ang mag-asawang Arroyo na makalabas ng bansa. Sa programang \"Usapang de Campanilla\" sa DZMM, ipinaliwanag ng abogadong si Atty. Noel Del Prado kung ano ang sinasabi ng batas sa pagpigil sa karapatan sa paglalakbay ng isang tao. \"Ang sabi ng Korte Suprema, tanging mga korte lamang ang binibigyan ng kapangyarihan, at iyan ay naaayon sa mismong probisyon ng Saligang Batas na ang mga korte lamang ang maaaring magbigay ng limitasyon sa ating karapatang maglakbay,\" ani Del Prado. Dahil dito, sinabi ng Korte Suprema na walang basehan ang kautusan ng DOJ na pigilan ang paglalakbay ng mag-asawang Arroyo. \"Ang sinasabi ng Korte Suprema dito sa partikular na kautusan ng dating kalihim ng Kagawaran ng Katarungan, sinasabi na walang pinagbabatayang batas, ibig sabihin walang legal basis, at dahil doon, hindi ito naaayon sa Saligang Batas,\" sabi ng abogado. Ayon kay Del Prado, puwede lamang magpatupad ng hold departure orders ang DOJ. Maaari itong ipatupad ng ahensiya sa pamamagitan ng Bureau of Immigration (BI) na nagbabantay sa mga paliparan at pantalan, sabi ng abogado. Samantala, puwede ring pigilan ng batas ang paglalakbay ng isang tao. \"Sa Konstitusyon, ang nakalagay lang doon, consideration of national security, public health, public safety, pero sa ating mga batas ngayon, meron nang ipinatupad ang Kongreso,\" sabi ni Del Prado. \"Halimbawa, 'yung batas natin laban sa terorismo, kapag ang isang tao ay nakasuhan ng terorismo at iyan ay naka-pending na sa korte, puwedeng limitahan ang kaniyang paggalaw,\" dagdag nito.",

        "content": "MANILA—A group of local religious leaders has joined those criticizing the government for the arrest and detention of an Australian nun on allegations of partisan political activities.  In a statement, the Association of Major Religious Superiors in the Philippines said the detention and possible deportation of Sr. Patricia Fox of Notre Dame de Sion is a form of harassment against an \"advocate of the rights of the poor.\" \"We are shocked that after 27 years of dedicated service to the poor, Sr. Pat was unduly arrested and detained for allegedly being an 'undocumented alien' and for participating in 'political activities,'\" the group said.  The group demanded that the government respect the rights of Fox and other foreign missionaries in the country who are working to \"alleviate the lives of the poor and powerless.\"  \"Even in her old age, Sr. Pat is fulfilling her prophetic mission to be in solidarity with the poor and powerless. And for this, she should be commended, not deported or harassed,\" the group added. On Monday, Fox was taken from her house and brought to the Bureau of Immigration office Monday after she took part in a human rights fact-finding mission in the south. She was freed the following day after outrage among human rights groups. Fox had been involved in human-rights missions in Mindanao, looking into the plight of indigenous peoples and farmers, some lawmakers said, almost a year after President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao.  Duterte, in a speech in Camp Aguinaldo, acknowledged he ordered Fox investigated for alleged \"disorderly conduct.\" The president also called the 71-year-old missionary foul-mouthed for criticizing the government while ignoring her own country's alleged misdeeds. Meanwhile, CBCP President Davao Archbishop Romulo Valles, a friend of the Duterte family, expressed concerns over the arrest of Fox. He assured that Filipino bishops are willing to extend any assistance and support for the Australian nun. ",

        "content": "MANILA- The government will ask the Supreme Court for more time to answer its order to hand over records of thousands of deadly encounters in its war on drugs, and will not comply until the President agrees, the national police chief said on Friday. The high court on April 3 gave police 15 days to comply with a December order to submit records related to the drug war, which the solicitor general attempted to block on the grounds of national security, arguing it could endanger police, informants and witnesses. \"As of this time, there is a motion being prepared,\" the new national police chief, Director Oscar Albayalde, told a news conference. He said the police would take orders from President Rodrigo Duterte before releasing any information about the drugs war. \"Maybe, even without the Supreme Court order, he may order us to give the records,\" he added. Supreme Court spokesman Theodore Te said he was unaware of any submission from the police. About 4,100 people have since June 2016 been killed by police and several thousand more by unknown gunmen whom the authorities have described as vigilantes, or rival gang members. Police deny activist allegations they have falsified reports, staged crime scenes and systematically murdered small time peddlers and users, and say those killed had violently resisted arrest. In December, the court ordered Solicitor General Jose Calida to submit details of those killed in police operations and other drug-related deaths. It also asked for information on each deadly encounter, the police and witnesses involved, and to see copies of warrants against all suspects who were killed. The order covers the period between July 2016 and November 2017, when 2 complainants, including a group of Manila slum dwellers, petitioned the court to make details publicly available. Calida filed a motion attempting to keep operational details secret, but the court dismissed that. Albayalde's predecessor, Ronald dela Rosa, on Wednesday said the 15-day deadline was unfeasible because the paperwork was \"voluminous.\"",

        "timestamp": "Apr 20 2018 04:41 PM",
        "content": "MANILA - The Sandiganbayan 4th Division found a former Philippine representative to the United Nations guilty of graft and malversation of public funds for irregular withdrawals of insurance claims he made for supposed leaking pipes and stolen jewelry of his wife. Lauro Baja, also a former Foreign Affairs undersecretary for policy, was charged by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2011 for the $17,524.27 he received from the Philippine government, which was deposited into an account he created and eventually closed in 2006. The case stemmed from his insurance claim for the damage caused by a broken pipe at the Philippine-owned townhouse at 15th East 66th Street in New York City, with checks amounting to $780, $12,504 and $1,379 deposited to a Philippine National Bank (PNB) New York account under the name “Philippine Mission to the UN-Renovation of Townhouse”. Prosecution witnesses Mario Lopez de Leon, then-Consul General in New York, and Crescente Relacion of the Foreign Service Office, stated that withdrawals were made by Baja in several transactions. Another witness, Philippine Mission to the United Nations in Geneva Finance Officer Tomas Valerio, said that it was the suggestion of Baja to open a separate account as the insurance proceeds are his money and that he was the one who engaged the contractors for the repairs. In his defense during trial, Baja said he sought clearance from Valerio and that there were receipts to prove that the contractors were hired and paid for. But the court noted that Baja presented photocopies of the receipts which are not acceptable under the best-evidence rule, which states that original documents must be produced. The court also noted the lack of transparency of Baja by not officially reporting the opening of the PNB account. “All told, it is a fundamental rule that government funds need to be disposed in the manner prescribed by laws and regulations and the procedure relative to its disposal are in place to ensure that the funds are used accordingly,” the court said in its decision penned by Associate Justice Reynaldo Cruz, with the concurrence of 4th Division chairperson Alex Quiroz and Associate Justice Bayani Jacinto. Baja was sentenced to 6 to 10 years in prison for graft and 10 to 17 years for malversation of public funds. He was also perpetually disqualified from public office and ordered to pay a fine of $17,547.27 or its peso equivalent. Also included in the insurance claims deposited in the PNB account were $2,500 for the reported stolen jewelry and cash of Baja’s wife. While the items are considered personal effects, the court ruled that the payment was not for Mrs. Baja per se as it was given to the New York Philippine Mission (NYPM) for the possible claim which she may file in connection with the lost items. “This would require Mrs. Baja to first file a claim against the NYPM for the lost/stolen property before the NYPM pays her for her loss,” the court said. Sought for comment, Baja said he would file a motion for reconsideration.  Last year, the same division of the Sandiganbayan dismissed a graft case against Baja involving receipts for Philippine Mission parties for lack of evidence that the transactions were fictitious or non-existent.\n   ",

        "timestamp": "Apr 20 2018 03:27 PM",
        "content": "MANILA - Solicitor General Jose Calida on Friday called on the Supreme Court to place Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno \"on equal footing with other public servants\" as he argued for the nullification of her appointment. Defending his \"quo warranto\" petition against Sereno, Calida, in a memorandum to the SC, said the top magistrate must be ousted because her appointment was \"void\" from the start. Calida said Sereno “cannot be excused from complying with the law” for failure to file and submit Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth, a requirement when she applied for the chief justice post in 2012.  “If lowly court employees could be penalized for failing to file SALNs, there is no reason why she should be considered eligible for appointment to the highest post in the judiciary notwithstanding her abject failure to comply with the SALN requirement,” Calida said. Sereno insisted that she could only be removed from office through impeachment.  Sereno, who is facing a separate impeachment case before the House of Representatives, submitted only 3 SALNs in 2009, 2010, 2011, when she applied for the top judicial post. The requirement was for the submission of at least 10 SALNs covering a decade preceding her application for the top SC post. Calida said Sereno’s 2009 SALN was invalid because it was filed in 2012 while her 2011 SALN was not signed by her husband. He also accused the top judge of fabricating her 2006 SALN, which was allegedly not notarized and signed only in 2010. He also cited Sereno's own argument during her predecessor, Renato Corona's impeachment trial, wherein she said people who assume public office accept \"burdens and obligations, together with its benefits.\" Citing the ongoing poll protest between former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. and Vice President Leni Robredo, who, like Sereno, is an impeachable officer, Calida again defended its quo warranto plea as the proper means to oust Sereno outside the mode of impeachment. The OSG, in its memorandum on the Sereno quo warranto case, cites ongoing Marcos-Robredo poll protest case before the SC, sitting as PET, in defending the quo warranto ouster proceeding against the CJ; says PET case vs VP Robredo also a mode outside impeachment: pic.twitter.com/GshgmmvQo4  “There is also an almost unanimous recognition that impeachment is not the only mode to remove impeachable officers,” Calida said. “It is therefore unseemly for [Sereno] to select a part of the Constitution that favors her cause and feign ignorance of another part that does not…” he added.  Sereno, for violations of the Constitution and other laws, is thus “usurping” and “unlawfully” holding the position of Chief Justice, Calida argued. In her earlier 77-page comment on Calida's petition, Sereno said it should be dismissed “for lack of jurisdiction and merit.\" “To rule otherwise, and to preempt the impeachment process by summarily ousting the Chief Justice via quo warranto, would be tantamount to overthrowing the Constitution itself,” Sereno said.",

        "content": "MANILA - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday described as \"malicious and oppressive\" charges filed against him by the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) in connection with the Dengvaxia mess.  \"Why implead a new secretary of Health who had nothing to do with the implementation and continuation? I find that malicious,\" Duque said in a press briefing.  Duque, along with other former and incumbent Health officials, were implicated in criminal complaints filed before the Justice Department on Thursday for alleged reckless imprudence resulting in homicide and violation of the Anti-Torture law. Parents of a teenager who died allegedly due to Dengvaxia filed the case with the assistance of PAO chief Persida Acosta. Duque, however, said he had nothing to do with the implementation of the dengue immunization program since he was only appointed to the DOH last October 2017.  He also slammed Acosta for not including former health secretary Paulyn Ubial in the charge sheet. \"Nagtataka ako bakit in-implead ako pero hindi in-implead si Ubial.\nI think she (Ubial) is equally liable because she continued it (dengue vaccination program) despite knowing the red flags,\" he said. The Dengvaxia vaccine was administered to about 800,000 school children. In November 2017, vaccine-maker Sanofi Pasteur admitted that the drug may cause severe dengue if administered to patients who never contracted the mosquito-borne disease.  Several parents sought for the PAO's help after they claimed that their children died due to complications brought by Dengvaxia. A congressional inquiry was held to probe the matter. Clinical evidence linking the dengue vaccine to the deaths have yet to be established.",

        "content": " JERUSALEM - Israel's defense minister said on Sunday a Palestinian scientist shot dead in Malaysia was a rocket expert and \"no saint\", but dismissed suggestions by Hamas that Israel's Mossad spy agency assassinated him.  Two men on a motorcycle fired 10 shots at Fadi al-Batsh, an engineering lecturer, in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, killing him on the spot, the city's police chief, Mazlan Lazim said.  Hamas, an Islamist militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, said one of its members had been assassinated in Malaysia. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said Mossad had been behind past attempts to kill Palestinian scientists, and the attack on Batsh \"follows this sequence.\"  Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said it was likely that Batsh was killed as part of an internal Palestinian dispute.  \"We heard about it in the news. The terrorist organizations blame every assassination on Israel - we're used to that,\" Lieberman told Israel Radio.  \"The man was no saint and he didn't deal with improving infrastructure in Gaza - he was involved in improving rockets' accuracy ... We constantly see a settling of accounts between various factions in the terrorist organizations and I suppose that is what happened in this case.\"  Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said on Saturday the suspects in the killing, who fled the scene, were believed to be Europeans with links to a foreign intelligence agency, state news agency Bernama reported.  He added that Batsh was active in pro-Palestinian non-governmental organizations, describing him as an expert in electrical engineering and rocket-building.  He could have been seen as \"a liability for a country that is an enemy of Palestine,\" Zahid was quoted as saying by Bernama.  Malaysian police chief Mohamad Fuzi Bin Harun said on Sunday that no arrests had been made.  Batsh was a lecturer at Universiti Kuala Lumpur, specializing in power engineering, according to the university.  Batsh's uncle Jamal al-Batsh, speaking to Reuters in the Gaza Strip, said he believed Mossad was behind the killing because \"Israel knows Palestine will be liberated by scientists\".  Hamas, which advocates Israel's destruction, fired thousands of rockets at Israel, most of them intercepted by an anti-missile system, during a 2014 Gaza war that included devastating Israeli attacks in the enclave of two million Palestinians.  In recent weeks, tensions have been running high at the Gaza-Israel border as Palestinians have ramped up protests demanding the right to return to homes that are now in Israel.  Israel's use of live fire, killing at least 35 Palestinians, has drawn international criticism. Israel says it is protecting its borders and takes such action when protesters come too close to the border fence. — Reuters",

        "content": " NEW YORK - A US push to change the Iran nuclear deal was sending a \"very dangerous message\" that countries should never negotiate with Washington, Iran's foreign minister warned as US and North Korean leaders prepare to meet for denuclearization talks.  Speaking to reporters in New York on Saturday, Mohammad Javad Zarif also said that for French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel \"to try to appease the president (Donald Trump) would be an exercise in futility.\"  Trump will decide by May 12 whether to restore US economic sanctions on Tehran, which would be a severe blow to the 2015 pact between Iran and six major powers. He has pressured European allies to work with Washington to fix the deal.  Macron and Merkel are both due to meet with Trump in Washington this week.  \"The United States has not only failed to implement its side (of the deal), but is even asking for more,\" said Zarif, who is in New York to attend a UN General Assembly meeting.  \"That's a very dangerous message to send to people of Iran but also to the people of the world - that you should never come to an agreement with the United States because at the end of the day the operating principle of the United States is 'what's mine is mine, what's yours is negotiable,'\" he said.  US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said earlier this month that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has \"looked at the Iran deal, he's seen what he can get and he's seen how he can push through loopholes and we're not going to let that happen again.\"  Under the Iran nuclear deal, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, struck the pact to try to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon but Trump believes it has \"disastrous flaws.\"  Zarif said if Washington leaves the deal, there were many options being considered by Tehran, including complaining through a dispute mechanism set up by the agreement or simply leaving the deal by restarting its nuclear activities.  \"We will make a decision based on our national security interests when the times comes. But whatever that decision will be, it won't be very pleasant to the United States,\" he said.  When asked if Iran could stay in the deal with the remaining parties, Zarif said: \"I believe that's highly unlikely because it is important for Iran to received the benefits of the agreement and there was no way Iran would do a one-sided implementation of the agreement.\"  Iran has always said its nuclear program was only for peaceful purposes and Zarif said if Tehran resumed its nuclear activities it would not be intended \"to get a bomb.\"  \"America never should have feared Iran producing a nuclear bomb, but we will pursue vigorously our nuclear enrichment. If they want to fear anything its up to them,\" Zarif said. — Reuters",

Dylan McWilliams, 20, was bodyboarding in the ocean off Kauai on Thursday, when what he believed to be a tiger shark between six and eight feet (around two meters) long chomped him on the leg, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reported.  The outdoorsman—who said he has worked as a survival training instructor—was able to swim around 30 meters back to shore, where a bystander called paramedics.  \"I didn't know if I lost half my leg or what,\" he said.  McWilliams, of Grand Junction, western Colorado, received seven stitches in hospital—just months after he was given nine staples in his scalp following an altercation with a black bear at a Colorado summer camp last July.  As he slept outdoors, McWilliams said he was awoken by the bear biting the back of his head. It then dragged him, only dropping its grip as he punched it and poked it in the eye.  \"I guess I was just in the wrong spot at the wrong time,\" he said of the attack, which caught the attention of media outlets worldwide.  The two attacks followed his first run-in with a rattlesnake during a Utah hiking trip. However, he told the Star Advertiser, the bite was not severe, and he was only ill for a couple of days.  \"My parents are grateful I’m still alive,\" he added. — Agence France-Presse",

        "timestamp": "Published  April 22, 2018 8:15pm",
        "content": " WASHINGTON — The first big showdown at the US Supreme Court over President Donald Trump's immigration policies is set for Wednesday when the justices hear a challenge to the lawfulness of his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries.  The case represents a test of the limits of presidential power. Trump's policy, announced in September, blocks entry into the United States of most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. Chad previously was on the list but Trump lifted those restrictions on April 10.  The high court has never decided the legal merits of the travel ban or any other major Trump immigration policy, including his move to rescind protections for young immigrants sometimes called Dreamers brought into the United States illegally as children. It has previously acted on Trump requests to undo lower court orders blocking those two policies, siding with him on the travel ban and opposing him on the Dreamers.  Trump's immigration policies—also including actions taken against states and cities that protect illegal immigrants, intensified deportation efforts and limits on legal immigration—have been among his most contentious.  The conservative-majority Supreme Court is due to hear arguments on Wednesday on the third version of a travel ban policy Trump first sought to implement a week after taking office in January 2017, and issue a ruling by the end of June.  The lead challenger is the state of Hawaii, which argues the ban violates federal immigration law and the US Constitution's prohibition on the government favoring one religion over another.  \"Right now, the travel ban is keeping families apart. It is degrading our values by subjecting a specific set of people to be denigrated and marginalized,\" Hawaii Lieutenant Governor Doug Chin said in an interview.  The Supreme Court on Dec. 4 signaled it may lean toward backing Trump when it granted the administration's request to let the ban go into full effect while legal challenges played out.  In another immigration-related case, the justices on April 17 invalidated a provision in a US law requiring deportation of immigrants convicted of certain crimes of violence. Trump's administration and the prior Obama administration had defended the provision.  'Politically correct'  Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Islamic militants. Just before the latest ban was announced, Trump wrote on Twitter that the restrictions \"should be far larger, tougher and more specific - but stupidly that would not be politically correct!\"  The challengers have argued the policy was motivated by Trump's enmity toward Muslims, pressing that point in lower courts with some success by citing statements he made as a candidate and as president. As a candidate, Trump promised \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"  The Justice Department argues Trump's statements as a candidate carry no weight because he was not yet president. The policy's challengers also point to views he has expressed as president, including his retweets in November of anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British political figure.  In a court filing last week, US Solicitor General Noel Francisco, representing Trump in court, said those retweets \"do not address the meaning\" of the travel ban policy.  Francisco cited Trump statements complimentary toward Muslims and Islam, including in a May 2017 speech in Saudi Arabia.  In defending the ban, the administration has pointed to a waiver provision allowing people from targeted countries to seek entry if they meet certain criteria. The State Department said that as of last month 375 waivers to the travel ban had been granted since the policy went into effect on Dec 8.  Some former Republican senators and officials who served in Republican former President George W. Bush's administration have signed onto legal briefs asking the high court to invalidate the ban.  \"I think the travel ban is a terribly misguided policy that appeared to be motivated more by a political intention of the president than by any real national security need,\" John Bellinger, the State Department's top legal advisor during the Bush administration, said in an interview.  The arguments in the case follow US missile strikes this month in one of the targeted countries, Syria, after Trump's administration blamed President Bashar al-Assad for a chemical weapons attack on Syrian people near Damascus.  \"Lots of people have pointed out the hypocrisy of the president on the one hand being willing to bomb Syria and on the other hand being unwilling to accept refugees and immigrants from that country who are trying to escape,\" lawyer Omar Jadwat of the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the travel ban in a separate case in Maryland, said in an interview.  Venezuela and North Korea also were targeted in the travel ban but those restrictions were not challenged in court. — Reuters",

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said in a statement that the shooting occurred at a Waffle House restaurant in Antioch, a suburb southeast of Nashville, at 3:25 a.m. (0825 GMT).  \"A patron wrestled away the gunman's rifle. He was nude & fled on foot. He is a white man with short hair,\" the statement added.  A following statement named 29-year-old Travis Reinking, of Morton, Illinois—a village located some 450 miles north of Antioch—as a person of interest. Police said the suspect arrived in a car registered to Reinking.  They added the gunman, who had shed his coat, was last seen walking on Murfreesboro Pike, where the 24-hour diner is located.  Local media citing police on the scene reported the gunman was armed with an AR-15 assault rifle—a weapon commonly used by mass shooters in the US, where debate over gun control is fierce and shootings are all too frequent.  Reports added at least one victim was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, located in Nashville itself.  AR-15 rifles were used to kill 58 people in Las Vegas last October, while Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz in February opened fire on his former high school with an AR-15 style rifle, killing 17 students and staff members.  In the wake of the Florida massacre, student survivors launched a gun control campaign—drawing hundreds of thousands to demonstrations—and businesses including Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods took measures to restrict access to assault weapons and firearms in general.  However, Congress is sitting on its hands when it comes to the issue.  Meanwhile, an ABC News/Washington Post poll published Friday suggested that support for a ban on assault weapons has risen sharply in the past few months.  Sixty-two percent of those polled said they support a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons, up from 50 percent in mid-February and 45 percent in late 2015. — Agence France-Presse",

        "content": "    KABUL, Afghanistan — A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a voter registration center in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday, killing at least 57 people and wounding more than 100, in the most serious attack yet on preparations for elections scheduled for October.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on a project of key importance to the credibility of President Ashraf Ghani's government, which has been under international pressure to ensure long-delayed parliamentary polls take place this year.  Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said a bomber on foot approached the center where officials were issuing identity cards as part of the registration process for around 10 million voters across Afghanistan. Registration began this month.  President Ghani issued a statement condemning the attack and said it \"cannot divert us from our aims or weaken this national democratic process.\"  A spokesman for the ministry of public health said at least 52 people were confirmed dead and 112 wounded. He said the total could climb.  The explosion destroyed cars and shattered windows in nearby buildings, leaving rubble strewn across the blood-stained street.  It was the deadliest blast in Kabul since about 100 people were killed in January by a bomb concealed in an ambulance and it came after repeated warnings that militants could try to disrupt the election process.  Tadamichi Yamamoto, the senior United Nations official in Afghanistan issued a statement condemning the attack.  \"Compounding the callous disregard for the lives of civilians, the killing appears to be part of a wholly unacceptable effort by extremists to deter Afghan citizens from carrying out their constitutional right to take part in elections,\" he said.  After weeks of relative calm, the blast took place in Dasht-e Barchi, an area of western Kabul inhabited by many members of the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority, which has been repeatedly hit by attacks claimed by Islamic State.  \"There were women, children. Everyone had come to get their identity cards,\" said Bashir Ahmad who had been near the blast, which occurred despite heightened security after the January attack.  According to UN figures, more than 750 people have been killed or maimed in suicide attacks and bombings by militant groups during the three months to March ahead of an expected start of the Taliban's normal spring offensive.  Bitter reaction  Afghanistan's international partners have insisted that the elections should be held this year before a presidential vote due in 2019, although there has been widespread skepticism that they will go ahead.  More than 7,000 voter registration centers have been set up across Afghanistan to handle about 10 million registrations.  Officials had pledged tight security to ensure the process proceeded safely. But those caught by Sunday's attack voiced frustration at what many Kabul residents see as government shortcomings in securing the capital.  \"They should be keeping the country safe, if they can't, someone else should be in their place,\" said Sajeda, who was wounded in the blast along with three other members of her family as they lined up for their cards.  The voter registration process, designed to reduce the electoral fraud that has marred past ballots, began this month but there have already been several attacks.  On Sunday, a roadside bomb near a registration center in the northern city of Pul-i Khumri killed six members of a family and wounded three, although there was no indication that the incident was directly linked to the Kabul attack.  Last week, two police officers in the eastern city of Jalalabad were killed outside a voter registration center, while a voter center in the central province of Ghor was burned down last week and electoral officials briefly abducted.  The vote could be postponed to next year if registration of voters, many of whom do not have national identity cards, is not completed before winter sets.  Parliament is still sitting three years after its term officially expired and further delays would seriously weaken already fragile confidence in the political system.  There was an additional scare on Sunday when a NATO military convoy in Kabul accidentally hit and injured a child and triggered a protest that police dispersed by firing into the air. A NATO spokesman said the child had been taken to hospital and was in a stable condition. — Reuters",

        "timestamp": "Published  April 22, 2018 4:40pm",
        "content": " Senator Panfilo Lacson on Sunday denied that he did not sign the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee's report on the Dengvaxia controversy because former President Benigno Aquino III had helped him in the past.  Lacson made the remark following panel chair Richard Gordon's \"unreasonable statements\" which seemed to suggest that he is pro-Aquino.  In a Super Radyo dzBB interview, Lacson said he did not receive any help from Aquino in his supposed involvement in the the Dacer-Corbito double murder case, which caused him to leave the country and become a fugitive for more than a year.  \"Ang issue ko sa kanya bakit naman siya magbabatikos agad na kaya 'di ako pumirma dahil tinulungan ako noong ako may kaso. Kaya kino-correct ko walang naitulong sa akin si dating Pangulong Aquino sa aking kaso,\" he said.  \"Ang tumulong sa akin ang katotohanan,\" he added.  Lacson said he spent most of his time hiding during the term of Aquino, making it impossible that he received help from the former president.  \"Bumalik ako [ng Pilipinas] March 26, 2011. Nawala ako January 7, 2010. Anong mas mahabang panahon na ginugol ko in hiding? 'Di ba panahon ni PNoy? Anong klaseng tulong 'yan?\" he said.  \"Ibig sabihin shooting from the hip bigla na lang siya babatikos, kaya ako nainis,\" he added.  Lacson said there is nothing wrong in him saying that he finds it difficult to believe that Aquino is capable of committing graft and corruption.  \"Yan ang aking experience sa working relationship kay Pangulong Aquino noong kami senador pa, magkasama kami sa Senate noon, at noong naging presidente siya. Ina-assault ko ba ang report niya by saying that? Of course not,\" he said.  \"Sariling opinion ko it is difficult for me to believe he was capable of committing graft and corruption, without giving reference to the committee report of Gordon kasi 'di ko nabasa ang committee report,\" he added.  Despite the rift, Lacson said he would not initiate Gordon's removal as chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee.  \"For all we know, this will be a learning experience for all of us, for Dick and myself included, para alam mo na, mai-correct namin ang direction niya na tinatahak tuwing magkakaroon ng pagdinig ang Blue Ribbon,\" he said.  \"Baka sa susunod na pagdinig pagbigyan niya kami magtanong. Sana maging conscious na siya ika nga,\" he added. —Erwin Colcol/ALG, GMA News",

        "timestamp": "Published  April 22, 2018 4:26pm",
        "content": " Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno has nothing to do with the disbarment complaints against lawyer Larry Gadon and the quo warranto request against Associate Justice Teresita De Castro, her spokesperson said Sunday.  \"Definitely none, sa totoo nga niyan nung nai-file itong disbarment complaint, tapos meron din 'yung letter sa Solicitor General na hinihimok mag-file laban kay Associate Justice de Castro, narinig na lang namin 'yun eh,\" lawyer Josa Deinla told Super Radyo dzBB in an interview.  Deinla insisted that their camp did not initiate the legal actions against Gadon and De Castro even if the petitioners are supporters of the Chief Justice.  \"Ang initiative ay 'di nagmula sa kampo ni Chief Justice,\" Deinla added.  Gadon, who filed the impeachment complaint against Sereno, is facing three disbarment cases for allegedly cursing at Sereno's supporters in Baguio City, making \"hateful\" remarks against Muslims in 2016, and for supposedly making perjurious statements and \"harassing\" court employees in relation to his bid to oust Sereno from power.  The complaints were filed by Zena Bernardo, Nona Andaya-Castillo, Natividad Dela Cruz Natividad, Jose Mari Tomines Callueng, Jennifer Aiza Santaolaya, Evangeline Hernandez, Faith Angelie Catalan, and Mark Vincent Lim.  Another Sereno supporter, Jocelyn Maria Acosta, has urged Solicitor General Jose Calida to initiate quo warranto proceedings against De Castro for \"lacking integrity as a member of the Supreme Court.\"  Acosta claimed that out of 39 Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALNs), De Castro submitted only 15 over the course of a decades-long government career starting in 1973.  The alleged incomplete submission of SALNs was Calida's basis for challenging the appointment of Sereno at the Supreme Court.  Calida's case against Sereno is nearing resolution, with Acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio saying a decision may be reached before May ends. —Anna Felicia Bajo/ALG, GMA News",

        "content": " A top official of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) was relieved from his post due to supposed extortion activities in his office, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said Sunday.  In an emailed statement, the DOTr said CAAP Airworthiness Inspector Colonel Rodolfo Moral was immediately terminated from his post due to extortion reports.  \"We want to send a strong message to everyone here in CAAP that we will not, in any way, tolerate corruption,\" CAAP Director General Captain Jim Sydiongco said in the statement.  \"That is unethical and it should be stopped,\" he added.  The DOTr accused the official of soliciting payments from a religious group in exchange for an airworthiness certification.  \"Initially, the religious group gave in to his demands and presented an undetermined amount, but Moral apparently was asking for more. It was at this point that the religious group sought the help of another airworthiness inspector who brought the matter to management,\" the DOTr said.  \"CAAP immediately conducted an investigation, and based on the initial findings, Moral's acts were recurrent. On the same day, the management decided to terminate his engagement,\" it added.  Moral will face possible criminal charges in violation of the Corrupt Practices Act. — Jon Viktor D.

        "timestamp": "Published  April 22, 2018 3:51pm",
        "content": "    HOUSTON — Former first lady Barbara Bush was remembered at her funeral on Saturday as a formidable but caring figure whose devotion to her family was matched only by her commitment to public service.  \"She was our teacher and role model in how to live a life of purpose and meaning,\" one of her four sons, former Florida governor and 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush, told the crowded Houston church.  He then drew laughs with a nod to Bush's famously sharp tongue: \"She called her style a benevolent dictatorship, but honestly, it wasn't all that benevolent.\"  Some 1,500 mourners, including governors, senators and former US presidents, gathered at a televised but invitation-only service at the church to pay tribute to the matriarch of one of the country's most prominent political dynasties, who died on Tuesday at age 92.  Bush, the wife of the 41st president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush, was lauded as an inspiration both to the country and her loved ones, a woman who leavened a strong sense of decency and honor with a self-deprecating wit she employed to great effect.  \"She was candid and comforting, steadfast and straightforward, honest and loving,\" said the historian and author Jon Meacham, who wrote a biography of George H.W. Bush and was one of three eulogists whom Barbara Bush herself selected before her death.  \"Barbara Bush and George Bush put country above party, the common good above political gain and service to others above the settling of scores,\" he said.     Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, current first lady Melania Trump, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former first lady Michelle Obama were all on hand for the service.  President Donald Trump, who clashed with the Bush family during his 2016 campaign, did not travel to Houston. The White House said this week he wanted to avoid disrupting the service with added security.  In a Twitter post, Trump said his \"thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family.\"  Former President Jimmy Carter was overseas and unable to attend.  Barbara Bush's longtime friend, Susan Baker, the wife of former Secretary of State James Baker, described her in a eulogy as a \"tough but loving enforcer\" whose 73-year marriage to her husband was a real-life fairy tale.  George H.W. Bush would write a letter to his wife on each wedding anniversary, Jeb Bush said, before reading aloud one such letter from 1994, a year after his father left the White House.  \"I was very happy on that day in 1945, but I'm even happier today,\" he read, as his 93-year-old father squeezed his eyes shut and wept. \"You have given me joy that few men know ... I have climbed perhaps the highest mountain in the world, but even that cannot hold a candle to being Barbara's husband.\"  To honor his late wife's commitment to literacy, the former president wore to the funeral a pair of colorful socks \"festooned with books,\" Bush spokesman Jim McGrath tweeted, adding that Barbara Bush had raised more than $100 million for the cause.  As the service ended, Bush's grandsons bore her casket out of the church, with George W. Bush pushing his father in a wheelchair directly behind it.  Barbara Bush was buried on the grounds of the George H.W. Bush Library and Museum at Texas A&M University in College Station, next to her daughter, Robin, who died of leukemia at the age of 3. The motorcade carrying her body traversed George Bush Drive and Barbara Bush Drive on its way there.  More than 700 Texas A&M cadets lined the driveway to the presidential library grounds as the cortege passed, the Houston Chronicle reported. When the last vehicle entered the property, the gates were closed ahead of the private ceremony, the newspaper said.  Members of the public had a chance to pay their respects on Friday, when Bush lay in repose at the church. George H.W. Bush, seated in a wheelchair in front of the casket, greeted mourners in turn with a handshake. — Reuters",

GMAKF and UAP-EA signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) at the SMX Convention Center on April 14 to rehabilitate the Datu Saber Elementary School in Barangay Saber, Marawi City.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  Standing on 300 square meters, the old Datu Saber School had 4 small classrooms for 450 students—and this number is expected to swell when more displaced families return and re-enroll their children.  The school is well-known in Marawi City because despite its cramped space, its students garnered high scores in consecutive National Aptitude Tests.  The UAP-EA is made up of an elite group of architects whose specialty and interest lie in post-disaster risk-resilient construction, emergency structures and site planning. The group was specifically tapped to respond to the unique challenges posed by the limited land area of Datu Saber Elementary School.  Datu Saber is only one of three schools in Marawi City that GMA Kapuso Foundation will be helping. The other beneficiaries of GMAKF’s rebuild and rehab plan in the city are Pendolonan and Camp Bagong Amai Pakpak Elementary Schools.  Signing on behalf of GMA Kapuso Foundation was EVP and COO Rikki Escudero-Catibog.  Signing for the UAP were outgoing national president Guillermo H. Hisancha and incoming national president Benjamin Panganiban.  For the UAP-EA, chairperson Marie Stephanie Gilles and deputy chairperson Jose Miranda were the signatories. UAP Ways and Means Committee chairperson Dante Aguirre was also on hand to witness the MOA signing as well as to get started on fund raising among construction supply sponsors and partners.  \"We need more donations to come in to help fund the Rebuild Marawi Project.

        "content": "    LUBAO, Pampanga — On March 23, strong gusts of wind hindered balloonists from taking off to the skies of Lubao, and event officials had to cancel hot air balloon flights on the first day of the Lubao International Balloon and Music Festival.  Instead, the balloons were inflated while tethered to the ground for the people’s viewing pleasure. Ultralight planes, a new addition to the festival’s roster of attractions, saved the day as they decorated the skies and soared throughout the day.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  The first concert made up for the morning’s lack of balloon flights and was a huge hit among festival-goers. They rocked out to songs from music sensations Kyoto and Ex Battalion. Well-known OPM band Silent Sanctuary played classic and new songs as people swayed to the music. Last act of the night Moira serenaded the crowd and made them tear up as she and her boyfriend performed Ed Sheeran’s “Perfect.”  On its second day, the Lubao International Balloon and Music Festival truly went five and up! The winds mellowed down as the sun went up and 30 colorful hot air balloons painted the skies of Pradera Verde, official venue partner of LubaoIBMF.  “It’s very fulfilling that we do it every summer,” said event chairman Noel Castro, when asked how he feels about the event reaching its five-year milestone.  “The wind condition in Lubao is perfect for flying the balloons,” he added.  Among the 30 balloons that flew during the three-day festival, there were eight in special shapes that piqued the interest of spectators. The Cristo Redentor or Christ the Redeemer balloon, piloted by Brazil native Renato Mathies, was particularly noticed because of its timeliness as Holy Week approached.  Maymay Entrata and Edward Barber, better known as the love team MayWard, made a special appearance on Saturday’s morning program. They attracted a huge crowd as they performed “Mahal Kita Kasi” and other popular songs. They also got to ride a tethered hot air balloon.  An exciting new day activity for LubaoIBMF 2018 is the Off-Road event. Rolf King of the National Association of Filipino Off-Roaders (NAsFOR) said of joining the event for the first time, “We’re very proud to have been invited by the hot air balloon festival of Lubao. You have activities both ground and air. I think it’s a very complete event.” A car show on the festival’s second day catered to vehicle enthusiasts as they anticipated the night’s concert.  Indie bands Autotelic and December Avenue opened the second night of the music festival. Michael Pangilinan went on next with his Himig Handog-winning “Pare Mahal Mo Raw Ako.” Crowd favorite Sarah Geronimo and special guests Jona Soquite and Ronnie Liang capped off the night in an emotional yet energetic set.  The fun and merriment carried on to third and final day of the festival while picturesque hot air balloons rose to the sky and landed in Bataan. Chase crews went after the pilots, helped the them put away the balloons, and brought them back to Lubao.  Morning entertainment was provided by the adored McLisse love team who provided a good dose of “kilig” to a big host of people. They performed a few songs including “If We Fall in Love.” There was a special performance where McCoy De Leon handed out flowers to lucky ladies watching; he fondly gave the last of the roses to Elisse Joson.  Ultralight planes once again graced the skyline of Pradera Verde as the rallycross activity provided by the Philippine Rallycross made its LubaoIBMF debut. The Off-Road attraction also continued their operations, providing great amusement to adrenaline junkies.  The final concert saw the most number of attendees, with OPM newcomers Ben&Ben and The Ransom Collective kicking it off as festival-goers went wild over their songs. The night got even more heated up when UDD hit the stage and performed to the crowd’s delight. Last but certainly not least, Bamboo ended the music festival with a bang as people jumped up and down in sync to his songs.  “Every time before I sleep, when we finish the balloon festival [for the day], I don’t want to go again. But every morning, when the balloons fly out, I feel like my stress also goes out,” said assistant event director Eugene Lee. “Especially during the Night Glow, I feel like I’m having a fantastic moment.”  The Night Glow is a special portion of the festival where balloons come out and are lit up for a unique display in between sets of each night’s performers.  The event drew 30,000 spectators per day on average. In between balloon flights and concerts, they were treated to various activities and attractions like archery, outdoor zoo, carnival rides, and plenty more.     Press release from the Lubao International Balloon and Music Festival",

(GMA NMI), a subsidiary wholly owned by GMA Network, to help improve video services on the GMA News site.  ”There is a clear demand for more video content in GMA’s websites, and this partnership with iVideoSmart boosts our capability to be more responsive to consumer needs. This dovetails perfectly with our efforts to strengthen GMA’s online footprint not just locally but globally as well, and is without doubt a forceful means to deepen consumer engagement with the GMA brand as a leading provider of premium content,” Judd Gallares, President and Chief Operating Officer of GMA NMI said of the venture.  iVideoSmart developed the world’s first video business in a box, which aims to help content owners better monetize their IP with a wide range of video solutions for native ad units. Using its proprietary AI-enabled platform, they aim to provide more relevant contextual videos as well as unique native ad units.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  iVideoSmart will also help to generate video views from page views, matchmaking the page content with organic video from the company-owned content exchange so that GMA expands its video offerings and increase video inventory.  Sze Chin Lee, Chief Operation Officer added “most of big data offerings in the market, including the largest digital platforms, aims at user profiling. We differentiate ourselves by framing the big data opportunity from the content angle, and by profiling content in a scale we believe can unlock most of the value in the media industry.”  Lastly, iVideoSmart will provide GMA the ability to provide dynamic ads into live streams giving them the ability to monetize just in time, in real time.  iVideosmart recently closed US$ 3.5 million Series A from leading VC Monk’s Hill Ventures, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and other two strategic investors.  The company plans to use the proceeds for commercial expansion and business development. With headquarters in Singapore and operations in the South East Asia, it is looking at both expanding in Asia and also in developed markets like USA, where the market rates for ads are higher.   ",

        "timestamp": "Published  April 22, 2018 7:28pm",
        "content": " HONG KONG —It has been jokingly referred to as \"Botmageddon.\" But a surge in new, anonymous Twitter accounts across swathes of Southeast and East Asia has deepened fears the region is in the throes of US-style mass social media manipulation.  Maya Gilliss-Chapman, a Cambodian tech entrepreneur currently working in Silicon Valley, noticed something odd was happening in early April.  Her Twitter account @MayaGC was being swamped by a daily deluge of follows from new users.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  \"I acquired well over 1,000 new followers since the beginning of March. So, that's approximately a 227 percent increase in just a month,\" she told AFP.  While many might delight in such a popularity spike, Gilliss-Chapman, who has previously worked for tech companies to root out spam, was immediately suspicious.  The vast majority of these new accounts contained no identifying photograph and had barely tweeted since their creation.  But they all seemed to be following prominent Twitter users in Cambodia including journalists, business figures, academics and celebrities.  She did some digging and published her findings online, detailing how the vast majority of accounts were recently created in batches by unknown operators who worked hard to hide their real identities.  She wasn't alone.  Soon prominent Twitter users in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka noticed the same phenomenon—a surge in follows from anonymous, recently created accounts, adopting local sounding names but barely engaging on the platform, as if lying in wait for someone's command.  'Organic users'?  While Facebook has received the lion's share of international opprobrium in recent months over allegations it has been slow to respond to people and state actors manipulating its platform, Twitter has also faced accusations it has not done enough to rid the platform of fake users.  Most bots are used for commercial spam. But they have been deployed politically in Asia before. During the 2016 Philippines presidential election, there was a surge of organized bots and trolls deployed to support the man who eventually won that contest, the firebrand populist Rodrigo Duterte.  And after Myanmar's military last year launched a crackdown against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, there was a wave of accounts that cropped up supportive of the government on Twitter, a platform that until then had very few Burmese users.  With elections due in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia in the next two years, many hit by the Twitter follow surge in Asia are asking whether the Silicon Valley tech giants are doing enough to stop fake accounts before they are given their marching orders.  So far Twitter has found nothing untoward.  A spokesperson for the company said engineers were \"looking into the accounts in question and will take action against any account found to be in violation of the Twitter Rules.\"  A source with knowledge of the probe said they believe the accounts are \"new, organic users\" who were likely being suggested prominent Twitter users across Asia to follow when they sign up.  \"It's something we're keeping an eye on, but for now, it looks like a pretty standard sign-up/onboarding issue,\" the source told AFP.  But many experts have been left unconvinced by such explanations.  \"Are there really this many new, genuine users joining Twitter, all with the same crude hallmarks of fake accounts?\" Raymond Serrato, an expert at Democracy Reporting International who has been monitoring the suspicious accounts, told AFP.  'Like a cancer'  The issue of fake users is hugely sensitive for Twitter because a crackdown could severely dent its roughly 330-million audience—the company's main selling point.  In a 2014 report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Twitter estimated some 5-8.5 percent of users were bots.  But Emilio Ferrara, a research professor at the University of Southern California, published research last year suggesting it could be double that: 9-15 percent.  Last week Pew Research Center released a report analyzing 1.2 million English language tweets which contained links to popular websites. Two-thirds of the tweets came from suspected bot accounts.  Twitter Audit Report, a third party company that scans people's followers using software to estimate how many are fake, suggests as many as 16 million of Donald Trump's 51 million followers are not real people.  Jennifer Grygiel, an expert on social media at Syracuse University, New York, said the US presidential election has provided a blueprint for others to copy.  \"Bad actors around the world have really followed the potential of social media to influence the political process,\" she told AFP.  Twitter, she said, is a minnow compared to Facebook's more than two billion users. But it can still be influential because many prominent opinion formers such as journalists, politicians and academics have a major presence on the platform.  \"If you can get information within this population, then you've scored,\" she said.  Serrato, from Democracy Reporting International, said the fake accounts could still pose a threat even if they are currently inactive.  \"The accounts can be used at a later date to amplify certain tweets, hijack hashtags, or harass people,\" he said.  Grygiel used a more blunt metaphor.  \"The risk is the accounts are sitting there like a cancer,\" she said. — AFP",

Across centuries, the worlds of legend and fiction embraced the concept: The ancient Greeks had Hephaestus and Talos, 19th-century England had Frankenstein and his monster and, near the turn of the 20th century, Italians had Geppetto and Pinocchio. Meanwhile, scientists swapped myth for math, positing that human thought could be simulated through the use of logical, systematic, and arithmetic methods.  From the Turing machine all the way to Deep Blue, AI has certainly come a long way.

When a user talks to Siri, the app recognizes and stores that voice command as a data file. Siri accomplishes this through a voice recognition algorithm that was likely developed using Supervised Learning, a subcategory of Deep Learning that involves being “trained” in advance to choose which course of action to take in a given situation. Afterwards, Natural Language Processing (NLP) enters the picture, enabling Siri to interpret the data file, convert it into text, and match the newly extracted information with the corresponding function on your device.  In short, Siri saves your verbal order as data, spells it out, and carries out your command on its own. Smart, indeed.  AI in job-hunting  Nowadays, AI also plays a role in matching people looking for work with potential employers. Recruitment technology company Kalibrr specializes in finding specific job vacancies for jobseekers, matching them using Deep Learning, Information Retrieval, Relevance Feedback, and NLP.  Kalibrr follows a Deep Learning model that allows it to get a better grasp of the job descriptions provided by prospective employers. This, in turn, enables the app to provide tailor-fit recommendations for both the job seekers and recruiters.    Like Siri, Kalibrr also employs NLP, applying it to job descriptions, candidate CVs, and so on, so that they can be translated into a format that the app’s software can process.  The app also looks at the job seeker’s history of actions (e.g. which job posts the person viewed) as well as the office’s (e.g. which candidate profiles the employer views frequently) in order to match them more precisely. Interestingly, the more you use Kalibrr, the more its recommendations become personalized and closer to your actual preferences.  AI in video games  Whether you’re the type of gamer who prefers the intricate, story-rich worlds of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) or the straightforward, shoot-em-up action of first-person shooter (FPS) games, you have almost certainly encountered bots in your game.  Though different genres of games have bots for different purposes, the basic concept remains the same: A built-in AI system that assumes the role a human player normally would, for the purposes of moving the game forward and enabling actual real-world players to have a more immersive experience. Normally, players can control how advanced or skilled the bots in their game is, depending on their preferences for that particular session. Among the standard capabilities programmed into bots are pathfinding abilities, in-game weapon and skill proficiencies, and even the ability to chat with players.  AI in transportation  Formerly known as GrabTaxi, Grab is currently the Philippines’ only ride-sharing app, after recently absorbing its largest local competitor Uber. Grab enables users to find personal drivers in real time, with corresponding pricing adjustments (“surges”) based on real-time factors that affect driver availability, the amount of time and traffic involved in getting from your pickup location to your destination, and so on.  The former VP of Data and Growth at Grab, Kevin Lee, spoke at Strata+Hadoop Singapore about how the app determines taxi availability and solves other problems through Machine Learning.      AI for getting programming and music recommendations  Have you ever wondered how Spotify whips up its always excellent Discover Weekly playlist? Or how Netflix seem to know exactly which shows to recommend to you?  Given the sheer number of choices out there, what are the odds that such entertainment platforms would be able to pick out “smart content” that actually suits your preferences?  Surprisingly good, actually — and that’s likely due to Deep Learning and Relevance Feedback.  Spotify, for example, has two key features for this purpose: Now and Radio. By applying Deep Learning, Spotify can identify common beats, themes, and other musical aspects across the vast expanse of songs in its library by examining their sound signals, looking at each song’s waveforms, and grouping similar ones together. This is how the Now feature is able to provide song recommendations with a common theme.     The Radio feature, on the other hand, uses Relevance Feedback to identify which songs you like and dislike. This assessment is based on numerous factors: whether you chose to give a song a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, how many times you’ve skipped them, if you’ve already deleted them from your playlist, and so on. Based on this, Spotify can identify and recommend songs similar to the ones you generally like, and avoid sending suggestions that are too similar to songs that you generally dislike.  These are just a few examples of how AI is present in our everyday lives. Given the rising popularity of smart technology and how more and more offices and companies are embracing the concept of the Internet of Things, we can expect AI to play an even bigger role in our future, perhaps even beyond what we’ve managed to imagine so far.  Skynet can keep their killer robots to themselves, though, thank you very much. — LA, GMA News",

        "timestamp": "Published  April 22, 2018 1:15am",
        "content": " ROME - In the United States, it is a wood-borer beetle that arrived in packaging and which has indirectly caused an estimated 21,000 premature human deaths. In South Korea, it is a worm that forced the government to cut down 10 million pine trees.  And in Africa, it is a maize-munching pest from the Americas that has infested millions of hectares of crops, and threatens the food supply and income of more than 300 million people.  What do they have in common? All three crossed continents to cause havoc on plants.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  Although such challenges have been with humankind since the advent of farming, experts warned this week that climate change and biodiversity loss could accelerate and expand their spread.  \"You are going to have extreme weather events that can spread these pests more readily,\" Geoffrey Donovan, an economist with the United States department of agriculture (USDA), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \"It cannot be a good thing at all,\" said Donovan, who has conducted studies on links between trees and human health.  Viliami Kami, chief entomologist at Tonga's agriculture ministry, agreed that higher temperatures, longer and more severe droughts, and stronger and more frequent cyclones could lead to pest and disease outbreaks.  Pests already cause losses of around $220 billion a year, or around 10-16 percent of harvests, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said at a conference this week.  At the same time, trade in agricultural products is vast: it is worth $1.1 trillion annually, the FAO said, of which food accounts for 80 percent.  But unless this process is carefully managed, it brings increased risks of pests and diseases taking hold in new countries, the FAO warned.  That can happen with the products themselves, but there are risks too with the packaging in which they are shipped: most is made of wood, said Lois Ransom, chair of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM), which organized the conference.  \"If you don't look after plant health, we would have massive challenges around achieving food security, protecting the environment and facilitating safe trade,\" Ransom told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of the conference.  Lasting impacts  CPM is the governing body for the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), an international treaty established in 1952 to prevent pests and diseases spreading across international borders via trade.  This week, the CPM adopted new and revised standards for countries to use to prevent pests from jumping borders, including the use of gas insecticide and heating technologies to treat wooden packing materials, killing pests deep inside.  Consequences of a failure to protect plants could go beyond hunger and jobs, and the impact can last generations, said Ransom, an assistant secretary at Australia's department of agriculture and water resources.  She pointed to how Ireland's 19th century potato famine killed an estimated million people and saw at least another million emigrate.  \"Imagine if Xylella in olives get into the Middle East, where olives are grown in small communities, supporting families,\" she said, referring to a vector-borne pest that can attack over 350 plant species, and which has already reached Italy and France.  \"If they can no longer grow the olives, then people may have to move. It's an area of social unrest anyway and ... you're just compounding a really difficult situation,\" Ransom added.  Prevention better than cure  The USDA economist Donovan urged experts and officials from 140 countries attending the conference to see trees as a public health infrastructure, \"a fundamental part of human well-being\".  In 2013, Donovan conducted a study that found U.S. counties infested with the emerald ash borer beetle had higher levels of human deaths linked to cardiovascular and lower-respiratory diseases.  \"And this increases as the infestation progresses ... the more trees die, the more people die,\" he told the conference.  The emerald ash borer, an invasive beetle native to Asia, has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in 31 states since it was confirmed in Detroit, Michigan, in 2002, Donovan added.  His study estimated more than 21,000 people had died in 15 states because there were fewer trees providing health benefits.  In South Korea, where pine trees are cultural, historical and ecological cornerstones, containing the pine wood nematode has cost over $600 million in 20 years, said Kyu-Ock Yim, senior researcher at the country's animal and plant quarantine agency.  \"There was the loss of forest and crop but there are so many indirect impacts too - the ecology, the social impact and the environment which are not easily estimated,\" said Yim.  Preventing the arrival of such pests and diseases - in this case, originally from North America - \"is the most cheap and effective way\", she added.  Yet this could be a challenge, with e-commerce on seeds and plants growing, and tourism a globally important industry.  \"The really problematic situations are where you get that continental shift - pests go from one continent to another where you've got hosts growing right through that continent,\" said Ransom, the CPM chair.  \"Once they're inside ... you can't do anything. You just got to try and mitigate the impact,\" she added.  Ransom also has advice for tourists eager to bring food from home or souvenirs from their travels in different continents.  \"Do not pack food. Do not take fresh fruit. Clean your camping equipment. It's about an awareness that (what you bring) can have an impact forever.\" — Reuters",

        "timestamp": "Published  April 21, 2018 3:56am",
        "content": " TAMPA, United States - Researchers have discovered the first evidence that people can genetically adapt to deep diving, as shown by the unusually large spleens in indigenous people of Indonesia known as the \"Sea Nomads,\" a study said Thursday.  The spear-fishing Bajau people regularly free-dive to depths of up to 230 feet (70 meters), with only weights and a wooden mask.  They spend up to 60 percent of their work day diving for fish, spearing octopus and gathering crustaceans -- an amount of time rivaled only by sea otters -- and can stay underwater up to 13 minutes at a time, said the report in the journal Cell.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  Intrigued by this unusual ability, American researcher Melissa Ilardo, then a post doctoral candidate at the Centre for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen, wondered if they had genetically adapted somehow to be able to spend more time underwater than other people.  She spent several months in Jaya Bakti, Indonesia, with the help of a translator, getting to know the Bajau and another nearby group that did not dive, the Saluan.  \"I spent my whole first visit to Jaya Bakti introducing myself, the project, and the underlying science,\" she told AFP.  \"I wanted to be sure that they understood exactly what I was asking of them so they could help to direct the project to reflect their interests. They were very curious and excited about the research.\"  Before her second visit, she learned some Indonesian in order to be able to communicate directly with the Bajau.  Scans and gene tests  She took genetic samples and did ultrasound scans, which showed that Bajau had spleens about 50 percent larger than the Saluan.  Spleens are important in diving -- and are also enlarged in some seals -- because they release more oxygen into the blood when the body is under stress, or a person is holding their breath underwater.  Spleens were larger in the Balau people whether they were regular divers or not, and further analysis of their DNA revealed why.  Comparing the genomes of the Bajau to two different populations, the Saluan and the Han Chinese, scientists found 25 sites that differed significantly.  Among them was one site on a gene known as PDE10A, which was determined to be linked to the Bajau's larger spleen size.  In mice, \"PDE10A is known for regulating a thyroid hormone that controls spleen size, lending support for the idea that the Bajau might have evolved the spleen size necessary to sustain their long and frequent dives,' said the study.  More research is needed to understand how thyroid hormone affects human spleen size.  The findings could boost research in medicine by helping researchers understand how the body reacts to a loss of oxygen in various contexts, from diving to high-latitude climbing to surgery and lung disease.  \"This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles,\" said co-author Eske Willerslev, a professor at the University of Copenhagen.  Willerslev admitted he initially urged Ilardo not to pursue the research for her PhD thesis, believing it was too risky and that she may find nothing.  \"She said she wanted to do it anyway and that paid off. Melissa was right and our concerns were wrong.\"  Ilardo said she was aware of the risks but \"believed so strongly in this project,\" that she had to push on.  \"The Bajau and other Sea Nomads are simply extraordinary and I wanted to be able to prove that to the world,\" said Ilardo, now a US National Institutes of Health postdoctoral scholar at the department of Molecular Medicine at the University of Utah. — Agence France-Presse",

        "timestamp": "Published  April 19, 2018 10:42pm",
        "content": " PARIS/CHICAGO - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday Sanofi's vaccine against dengue should only be used after testing on individuals to assess whether they have ever been exposed to the infection.  After a two-day meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, experts at the U.N. agency recommended extra safety measures for the medicine.  \"We have now clear information that the vaccine needs to be dealt with in a much safer way by using it exclusively in people already infected with dengue before,\" Alejandro Cravioto, Chair of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, told reporters.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  \"It requires for the people to be tested through a system that is not currently available but that we feel will be developed in the next years,\" he said.  A spokeswoman for Sanofi had no immediate comment.  The French drugmaker warned in November that the vaccine, first approved in late 2015 and sold under the brand Dengvaxia, could increase the risk of severe dengue in some cases in people who had not been previously exposed to the disease.  Mosquito-borne dengue is the world's fastest-growing infectious disease, afflicting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It causes half a million life-threatening infections and kills about 20,000 people, mostly children, annually.  HEALTH SCARE  Dengvaxia, the world's sole licensed vaccine against dengue, is at the center of a health scare in the Philippines where the government suspended its use last year amid safety fears.  The company has repeatedly said it knows of no deaths resulting from the medicine.  Joachim Hombach, executive secretary of WHO's SAGE group, said: \"For us, the primary consideration is to assure our recommendation makes public health sense in terms of ensuring the use of vaccine will maximize public health benefit and minimize risk.\"  \"It is very important we signal ways in which this vaccine could be used,\" he said, adding that it was up to the company to decide how to deal with this.  Hombach defended the WHO's initial recommendation that the vaccine could be used in children aged 9 and older in places where 70 percent of the population had previously been exposed to the virus, and were likely to benefit from the vaccine.  He said the WHO pointed out a gap in data on the use of the vaccine in people who had never been exposed to the virus, and asked Sanofi to study the impact of the vaccine on children who had never been exposed to the virus.  COMMITTED  Executives at Sanofi have denied any wrongdoing and insist on the benefits the medicine brings as a whole.  In a interview with Reuters last month, David Loew, head of Sanofi Pasteur, the group’s vaccines division, said Sanofi remained committed to Dengvaxia.  He added Sanofi was holding discussions with external partners and universities to come up with a test which would be applicable before vaccination. Such a test, however, would take at least two years to bring to the market, he said.  Dengvaxia has been approved and registered in 19 countries and is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency.  Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical, the United States National Institute of Health and Brazil's Butantan Institute are developing rival products.  Initially touted as potential $1-billion-a-year-plus product, Dengvaxia net sales stood at 3 million euros ($3.71 million) in 2017 as Sanofi was forced to buy back unused doses. The company took a charge of 87 million euros in the fourth quarter. ($1 = 0.8090 euros) — Reuters",

The parent planet was about as large as Mars or Mercury, and was formed in our Solar System's first 10 million years before being shattered to pieces in collisions with other space rocks, a European team reported.

And it boosts the theory that today's Solar System planets were forged from the remains of tens of large \"proto-planets.\"  The asteroid, whose dramatic collision with Earth in October 2008 had been forecast by astronomers, fell into a category of space rocks called ureilites, which account for less than one percent of objects that hit Earth.

        "content": " PARIS, France - Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in the first address to France's parliament by a Canadian leader, called on the signatories of the 2015 Paris climate accord to ensure the landmark deal became a \"reality\".  Trudeau, one of just a handful of foreign leaders given the honor of a parliament speech since 1958, said the risks presented by global warming could be tackled only by global action -- an implicit dig at US President Donald Trump's move to withdraw from the deal.  The individual commitments by more than 190 nations under the Paris Agreement are aimed at limiting the warming of the planet to between 3.6 and 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (two and three degrees Celsius).–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  \"It's up to us to make this accord in principle a reality,\" Trudeau said in a speech that earned several standing ovations.  \"Our two countries are united in their ambitions for fighting climate change, even as we pursue sustainable growth for our economies,\" Trudeau said on the last day of his two-day visit to France.  \"On both sides of the Atlantic we are making unprecedented investments in clean technologies and green infrastructure, stimulating growth and creating good middle-class jobs,\" he said.  \"It's up to us to seize the many possibilities for business and jobs offered in a carbon-light economy.\"  But Trudeau has drawn fire from ecologists at home for backing the Trans Mountain oil pipeline from Alberta's oil sands to the Pacific Ocean, a controversy that forced him to cut short a trip to Peru last week.  In an interview with French media before his visit, Trudeau defended his support of the pipeline, saying \"we cannot choose between what is good for the environment and good for the economy.\"  ‘New era’  Trudeau also touted Canada's historic business ties with France, saying a recently agreed trade deal between Canada and the EU showed that business could go hand-in-hand with \"social and environmental progress.\"  The CETA deal \"goes further than any other trade deal in the world,\" he said, citing \"the protection of personal rights, the environment and citizen mobility.\"  The accord has been applied provisionally since late last year, and still must be ratified by EU member states -- some French lawmakers have already warned they won't support the deal.  But Trudeau appeared undeterred. \"Let's ask a question,\" he told parliament. \"If France can't ratify a free-trade accord with Canada, with what other country could you do it?\"  \"It maintains the rights of nations to legislate and regulate in the public interest, to implement policies that protect their cultural industries and labor rights,\" he said.  The CETA deal had already bolstered French exports to Canada by four percent since last September, Trudeau said, with increases of up to eight percent for agriculture and food products.  Canadian investments in France, meanwhile, jumped 23 percent last year.  \"All these examples highlight a single reality: trade, when it is properly regulated, benefits the greatest number of people,\" he said.  \"CETA is simply the starting point for a new era of cooperation and integration.\" — Agence France-Presse",

Ang National Housing Authority at maging ang ilang lokal na pamahalaan, binigyan ng mandato na magtayo ng abot-kayang pabahay para sa mga mahihirap. Pero ang ilang itinayong pabahay, iniwang nakatiwangwang at hindi naman natitirahan.  Sa bayan ng Pavia sa Iloilo City, matatagpuan ang isang housing project para sa mga empleyado ng munisipyo. Pero pagdating sa pabahay, halos hindi mo na makita ang mga housing unit. Balot na kasi ang mga ito ng makapal na halaman at matataas na talahib. Ilang hayop rin gaya ng kambing ang nakita namin sa paligid ng inabandonang housing units. 2001 pa sinimulang itayo ang pabahay, pero hindi ito natapos. Wala ni isang empleyado ang tumira rito.–– ADVERTISEMENT –– –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  Sa Iligan City, Lanao del Norte, matatagpuan naman ang Bay Vista Village Housing. Itinayo ang pabahay para sa mga naging biktima ng bagyong Sendong noong 2011. Nasa 400 million pesos ang inilaan na pondo ng gobyerno para magtayo ng nasa 1400 housing units. Sa kasalukuyan, nasa 1,170 na ang naitatayong unit pero nasa 331 pa lamang ang okupado. Nang puntahan namin ang mga unit na wala pang nakatira, nadatnan namin ang ilan na wala pang mga pinto, bintana at wala ring linya ng kuryente. Ang ilan, may mga bitak sa mga pader. Sa gitna ng aming pag-iikot, nakilala namin ang isa sa mga residente ng pabahay na si Liza. Maging sila na nakatira na sa pabahay, marami pa ring idinaraing na problema. Ang kanilang housing unit kasi, wala pa ring suplay ng tubig at kuryente kahit na noong nakaraang taon pa sila lumipat dito.
