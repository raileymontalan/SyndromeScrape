    "content": "MANILA - Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said he is eyeing a “better looking” millennial to help him carry out the critical task of speaking on behalf of President Rodrigo Duterte. Roque, 51, said he wants a deputy spokesperson younger than him to convey the President's message to younger Filipinos.  He said he has picked for the job his former student at the University of the Philippines College of Law who is currently preparing for the bar examinations. He has yet to tell his chosen one but he is confident that he could persuade him to accept the offer. “I want a millennial. Number two, I want someone better-looking... than me so that the women will fall in love with him. And I want someone who speaks better than me. I promise the women, you will like the person I have in mind,” Roque said during his first news conference in Malacañang. “There’s always someone who should be able to give the Palace position on different issues, and I think I’m choosing this person because I want a link between a 72-year-old President and the millennials of today. You will not be disappointed with my choice.” Roque said he needs a deputy since he wants to do some of his work in war-torn Marawi City, where government is setting a rehabilitation program after its liberation from Islamic State-inspired terrorists. The city, once a bustling commercial and cultural capital, was ravaged by five months of firefights between state forces and Maute terrorists.  “It’s an innovation that I thought of because the rebuilding is soon to begin and I think the people should know exactly what’s happening on the ground,” he said. “That’s why it’s going to be very difficult for me to be flying to Marawi every Tuesday evening. It’s a very long drive from Cagayan de Oro. It’s very complicated for security reasons and logistic reasons but I want to do that because I want to bring Malacañang to areas where, you know, attention should be devoted.” Roque, meanwhile, said he has no immediate plans of reorganizing the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson. “I’m not going to reinvent the wheel ‘no dahil naririyan na ‘yung karamihan sa kanila. I’m sure they can stay. And I will repeat what I have said: No one will lose their jobs because it’s Christmas. If there will be individuals that will be let go, we will wait until after Christmas and as I said, I would want to take advantage of the experience of people who are already here,” he said. “But please understand that as a Cabinet post, I also need to bring in people whom I can completely trust. And that’s the only reason why I’m bringing in new personalities.”",

Itinuturong salarin ang dalawang hardinero ng biktima na edad 15 at 17.

    "content": "Umaaray at mababa na umano ang morale ng mga empleyado ng Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) sa pagsuspinde ng kanilang mga \"unauthorized\" allowances matapos sitahin ng Commission on Audit (COA).  Sa panayam ng DZMM, ikinuwento ni PCSO Chairman Jose Jorge Corpuz ang daing ng kaniyang mga staff dahil sa natapyasang take-home pay. \"Malaki po ang effect sa mga empleyado, na-low morale po sila...Example yung aking staff in my office, [one of them] about P12,000 per month ang nawala sa kaniya. Ang take home [pay] niya na lang naging P600,\" pagbabahagi ni Corpuz.  Ayon kasi sa annual audit report ng COA para sa 2016, aabot ng halos P518.3 milyon ng hindi awtorisadong benepisyo ang tinanggap ng mga empleyado ng PCSO. Ilan sa mga ito ay napunta sa Christmas bonus, 14th at 15 month pay, educational assistance, grocery allowance, at iba pang klaseng benepisyo. Pero depensa ni Corpuz, ang mga nasabing bonus ay nakagawian na simula pa noong mga nakaraang administrasyon dahil parte umano ito ng mga compensation package ng mga empleyado.  Aniya, taon-taon naman daw naglalabas ng notice of disallowance ang COA laban sa kanilang ahensiya ngunit nasosolusyunan daw ito sa pamamagitan ng \"post-facto approval\" ng nakaupong Pangulo.  \"For the past years, binigyan po yan ng approval ng mga previous administrations,\" paliwanag ni Corpuz. Subalit ito'y nagbago nang maupo si Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte, na makailang ulit sinabing dapat nang itigil ang nagsisilakihang allowances ng mga empleyado ng gobyerno.  Agosto nila natanggap ang pasabi ng Office of the President (OP) na hindi inaprubahan ang kanilang \"post-facto\" request kaya't Setyembre pa lang ay suspendido na ang mga benepisyo ng mga tauhan ng PCSO. \"This present administration gave us a straightforward answer na they disapproved. 'Dinisapprove' po ng OP yung request,\" ani Corpuz. Hinaing ni Corpuz, ang mga nasabing \"perks\" ay \"all accounted for\" o kayang ipaliwanag.  Dagdag nito, ang mga benepisyo ay isa lamang hakbang para makasabay ang mga taga-PCSO sa antas ng pasahod sa ibang kumpanya.  \"Kasi naman 'yung GOCCs (government-owned and controlled corporations), hindi po kami kasali sa salary [increases] since 1989, nu'ng lumabas po 'yung salary standardization...so habang nag-i-increase 'yung ibang kumpanya, 'yung PCSO naman, ito lang ang compensation package namin which is very low,\" saad ni Corpuz.  Paniguro ni Corpuz, hahanapan nila ng lunas ang hinaing ng mga taga-PCSO. \"So now we're finding solutions how to compensate, to soften the impact on our personnel,\" ani Corpuz. ",

The Philippines joined southeast Asian countries Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand in the Chinese-led drill, the largest joint maritime rescue exercise yet held in waters off the Chinese port city of Zhanjiang on Oct. 31. Among the participants, Brunei also has partial claims to the waters. Notably absent in the drill were other South China Sea claimants Vietnam and Malaysia.  The drill was sponsored by the Ministry of Transport of China and joined by search and rescue agencies of ASEAN countries, according to a report posted on the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's official website.  The report cited how maritime cooperation is necessary as ships from the ASEAN navigate the South China Sea, quoting Zhuang Zeping, deputy director of the Guangdong Maritime Search and Rescue Center and the Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration.  “...[T]he goal of the drill is to explore ways of increasing the success rate of maritime search and rescue as much as possible based on the human life-first concept,” said Zhuang.  The Chinese defense ministry said the drill is a joint action between China and ASEAN to implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and improve cooperation in search and rescue drills. The exercise, involving around 1,000 rescuers, 20 ships and 3 helicopters, were participated by the PH, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Brunei. pic.twitter.com/XB09p36gnG  The exercise, held ahead of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in the Philippines this month, involved around 1,000 rescuers, 20 ships and 3 helicopters. The sea dispute is expected to be discussed at the summit, where ASEAN dialogue partners, including major powers China and the United States, are expected to participate.  At the ASEAN meeting in Manila in April, the regional bloc issued a statement that called for compliance with international law but was silent on continuing Chinese incursions in the disputed waters.  China has consistently asserted its expansive claims over nearly all of South China Sea, ignoring a July 2016 United Nations arbitration ruling on a Philippine case that invalidated its nine-dash line claim. ",

Sa kuha ng CCTV sa Asuncion Street sa Tondo, Maynila, makikitang sumakay sa isang sports utility vehicle (SUV) ang dalawa sa apat na lalaki.  Inaatras ng mga ito ang sasakyan habang inaalalayan ng kasamahan. Kalauna'y dumating ang isang motor na minamaneho ni Robel Intal, isang barangay kagawad. May sinabi si Intal sa nagmamaneho ng SUV bago umalis. Paliwanag ni Intal, binalaan lamang niya ang mga nasa SUV na mahihirapan sila sa pag-atras ng sasakyan dahil sa trapiko. Binaba nang husto ng driver ng SUV ang bintana sabay arangkada para habulin ang kagawad. Dahil sa trapiko, bumaba na lamang siya ng sasakyan. Nakihabol din ang mga kasamahan nitong mula sa ibang sasakyan. Iniwan nila sa gitna ng kalsada ang dalawang sasakyan. Sa kuha ng isa pang CCTV, makikitang walang kaalam-alam si Intal na hinahabol na siya ng apat na lalaki. Nang maabutan, kinompronta si Intal at tinutukan ng baril ng lalaking nagmamaneho ng SUV. Bukod sa pagtutok ng baril, pinababa rin si Intal sa motor at sinaktan ng mga lalaki. Matapos ang insidente, nagsumbong si Intal sa mga pulis. Kinilala ng mga pulis ang lalaking nagmamaneho ng SUV at nanutok ng baril bilang si Neil Tristan Gutierrez Boma. Pinuntahan ng ABS-CBN News ang sinasabing bahay ni Boma para humingi ng panayam pero wala umano siya roon. Ayon kay Intal, pinuntahan siya ni Boma para humingi ng dispensa pero sinampahan pa rin niya ng kasong grave threat, physical injuries, at usurpation of authority ang mga lalaki. -- Ulat ni Zyann Ambrosio, ABS-CBN News",

    "content": "MANILA – Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday admitted that his predecessor Ernesto Abella is a tough act to follow. Roque, known for being vocal on issues he is passionate about, told reporters he may find it hard to be as “calm” as Abella, a pastor. “He is a good friend of mine. You know that we belong to the same church. He is one of our pastors. I think he did a brilliant job as spokesperson,” Roque said during his first news conference in Malacañang. “I don’t think I can ever be as a calm as [Undersecretary] Abella. And that’s why he’s a very difficult act to follow. I have asked for his prayers and I will pray for him. But I’m sure there is something in store for [Undersecretary] Abella.” President Rodrigo Duterte last week announced he has chosen media-savvy Roque as his new spokesperson. He, however, has not revealed why he chose to replace mild-mannered Abella. Reports, however, said Duterte was unhappy about Abella's handling of media queries on the double-digit drop in his net satisfaction and net trust ratings in the latest Social Weather Stations survey. Roque has said he and Duterte would surely be an “explosive” tandem, adding he might not curse like the President but that he would likely scream. He also promised to follow the President’s top order not to lie to the public.  “I realized that my working relationship with the media, having defended many of you for libel and having prosecuted cases involving members of the media, should help me in this new undertaking,” he said. “I assume this obligation cognizant of the importance of the free marketplace of ideas and I assume this obligation recognizing that the people do have a right to information on matters that affect them,\" he said. ",

    "content": "MANILA - The Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin its hearings into a criminal complaint against a woman allegedly engaged in the recruitment, through social media, of foreign fighters to augment Maute fighters in the Marawi City siege. Karen Aizha Hamidon, 36 years old, is facing 14 counts of violation of Article 138 (inciting a rebellion or insurrection) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Republic Act (RA) No. 10175, also known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. She was arrested by operatives of the National Bureau of Investigation-Counter Terrorism Division at her residence in Taguig City on October 11, the same day she posted on social media another call for local and foreign Muslims to help Maute fighters in Marawi City. Hamidon is reportedly the wife of Mohammad Jaafar Maguid aka “Tokboy” and “Abu Sharifa,” who formerly led the group allegedly responsible for the September 2016 night market blast in Davao City, which calls itself Ansarul Khalifa Philippines (AKP), also known as the “MaguidGroup.” Maguid was killed in January 2017 by government forces in Sarangani province. The Philippine government has named AKP as one of “four ISIS-linked local rebel groups,” with operations in “different parts of Mindanao,” along with the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) from Basilan; Maute Group from Lanao del Sur; and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) based in the Liguasan Marsh, Maguindanao. “These groups have formed an alliance for the purpose of establishing a wilayah, or Islamic province, in Mindanao,” the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) told the Supreme Court (SC) in June, during the pendency of petitions challenging President Duterte’s declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao. Hamidon is also being linked to Australian Islamist preacher Musa Cerantonio, and reportedly also former wife to Singaporean national Muhammad Shamin Mohammed Sidek, who was detained for his links with ISIS.

    "content": "MANILA – Incoming Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said there is no reason to doubt President Rodrigo Duterte's statements, stressing that the Chief Executive would not make claims without factual bases. Roque said this when asked to comment on Duterte’s oft-repeated claim that the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is out to remove him from office or even kill him, an allegation that US Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim and a White House official have denied. “Well, if that is true, we’re happy,” Roque said of the statements from the two US officials. “But if the President says that there is, I have no position to dispute what the President says. The President has access to information that he only has access to. I have not seen it. But I trust and believe that my President will not say anything without factual basis. I stand by whatever my President says,” said Roque.  Critics have called out the President for supposedly making incorrect claims in his speeches, including his estimate that there could be 4 million \"drug users\" in the Philippines.  The Dangerous Drugs Board's (DDB) count was at 1.8 million. In May, Duterte fired DDB chairman Benjamin Reyes for supposedly contradicting his estimate. The President has also given various figures on the number of policemen supposedly involved in the illegal drug trade. In an interview on state-run PTV4 aired on Sept. 29, Duterte claimed there were 17,000 cops “involved in drugs.” But in a speech in Balangiga, Eastern Samar on Sept. 28, he claimed that at least 9,000 cops were involved in the illegal drug trade. Administration critics have accused Duterte’s supporters, including his appointees, of allegedly spreading fake news that seem to demonize members of the opposition and mislead the public.",

Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano in a statement said the incident, which left 8 people dead and at least 11 others injured, shows that the threat of terrorism \"remains real.\" \"The terrorist attacks in New York and other places abroad during the past several weeks tell us the threat remains real,\" Cayetano said in a statement. Eight people were killed and numerous others were wounded in New York on Tuesday when a man rammed a pickup truck onto pedestrians and collided with a school bus in Lower Manhattan in what US authorities called an \"act of terror.\" The suspect is an Uzbek immigrant who reportedly left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group. The Islamic State recently made its presence felt in the Philippines, when its followers from the Maute terror group laid siege on Marawi City, triggering the worst urban conflict the country has seen since World War 2.  The crisis left more than 1,100 dead, most of them terrorists, and displaced the city's more than 200,000 residents and thousands more from nearby towns. Government last week announced the end of hostilities in the city after five months of firefights.  Cayetano said the fight against terrorism is a key priority of President Rodrigo Duterte and is among issues to be discussed among world leaders at the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Manila later this month. \"The Philippines is more than ready to do its share in helping make the world a safer place,\" Cayetano said, as he rallied the international community to intensify its efforts in going after the Islamic State and its affiliate organizations around the world. He added that Manila is looking forward to cooperating with other countries, particularly in intelligence sharing and capacity-building, as part of the country's counter-terrorism efforts.",

That was a decision made by the donor and we can’t do anything about it.” The rehabilitation facility was seen to help drug users and pushers who had surrendered under the government's anti-drug campaign, but only 311 have been admitted in its first phase as of June this year. Santiago, former head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, said admitting drug dependents to the treatment center must have been difficult because of its distance. \"Saan mo panggagalingan 'yun?

    "content": "MANILA- Nearly half of Filipinos think that the killing of innocent people is inevitable \"to completely eradicate the illegal drug problem in the country,\" results of a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed. The Sept. 23 to 27 poll of 1,500 adults showed that 46 percent of Filipinos believe the killing of those who have nothing to do with the drug trade could not be completely avoided in the fight against illegal drugs. Some 35 percent disagreed while 19 percent were undecided, resulting in a \"moderately strong\" net agreement score of +10. The number of people who believe collateral damage is unavoidable in the drug war is highest in the Visayas, which has a \"moderately strong\" +21 score, followed by Metro Manila at a \"moderately strong\" +18, Balance Luzon at a \"neutral\" +9, and Mindanao at a \"neutral\" +1. The SWS said survey results showed that net satisfaction scores of the government's campaign against illegal drugs (good +56) and of President Rodrigo Duterte (good +44) tend to be lower among those who disagree that innocent casualties cannot be avoided in the drug war, compared to those who agree (excellent +70 and very good +52, respectively) and were undecided (very good +59 and very good +53, respectively). Nearly half of Filipinos (49 percent) meanwhile think that the government has used people to secretly observe and report those involved in the use and selling of illegal drugs.

The agreement was highest in Metro Manila, with a net agreement score of +50 or \"extremely strong,\" followed by Balance Luzon at a \"moderately strong\" +29, Mindanao at a \"moderately strong\" +26, and the Visayas at a \"moderately strong\" +21. Net satisfaction with the President (good +38) tends to be lower among those who disagree that the government probably has people who secretly observe and report drug users and pushers, compared to those who agree (very good +52) and were undecided (good +47). The SWS has been releasing a series of surveys gauging public opinion on several aspects of the drug war.   ",

Isa na rito ang Tzu Chi Foundation na dismayado sa sitwasyon ng basura sa Manila North Cemetery. Tambak kasi ang mga plastic, styrofoam, paper plate, at pinagkainan sa sementeryo. Anim na taon nang hinihikayat ng Tzu Chi Foundation ang pag-recycle at pag-segregate, o maayos na pagpapangkat sa mga basura sa lugar.  Anila, hindi na natuto ang mga bumibisita sa sementeryo kahit paulit-ulit na paalalahanan. Pero ayon kay Janet Rivera, isa sa mga tagapaglinis sa Manila North Cemetery, nakasanayan na niya ang tone-toneladang basurang nakukuha sa sementeryo taon-toan. Sa Manila South Cemetery naman, dalawang truck ang nag-ikot nitong Huwebes ng umaga para maghakot ng mga kalat. Manila South Cemetery, nililinis na; mga tindahan, nagsimula na ring magligpit @ABSCBNNews pic.twitter.com/DCnaypUvnP  Nagpakalat din sila ng mga tauhang magwawalis sa lugar. Pero mas kaunti raw ang basura ngayon kumpara noong isang taon dahil mas kaunti ang mga taong bumisita, ayon kay Maribel Bueza, administrador ng Manila South Cemetery. Ikinagalit din ng environmental group na EcoWaste Coalition ang pagtatapon ng basura sa mga libingan. Pambabastos umano ang pagkakalat sa alaala ng mga yumaong nakahimlay sa sementeryo. Batay sa Ecological Solid Waste Management Act, puwedeng patawan ang mga magkakalat ng multang P300 hanggang P1,000 o kaya'y puwersahing mag-community service sa loob ng 15 araw. -- Ulat ni Jervis Manahan, ABS-CBN News",

    "content": "Ilang kaanak ng mga miyembro ng teroristang grupong Maute ang hawak at iniimbestigahan ng mga awtoridad matapos matagpuan sa loob ng main battle area sa Marawi City. Ayon kay Col. Romeo Brawner, deputy commander ng Task Group Ranao, ilan sa mga nasagip nila kamakailan bilang bahagi ng clearing operations ay mga anak at asawa ng mga Maute. Ngunit iimbestigahan pa rin ang mga nasagip, lalo na ang mga misis, dahil posibleng mga tagasuporta ito ng teroristang grupo. \"Iniimbestigahan ng [Criminal Investigation and Detection Group] 'yong mga asawa kasi kailangan nating malaman kung ano involvement nila,\" ani Brawner sa panayam ng DZMM. Batay kasi sa kuwento ng ilang bihag, may ilang asawa ng mga Maute na nakipagsagupaan din laban sa tropa ng pamahalaan. Bahagi rin umano ng clearing operations ang paghanap sa mga naiwang \"stragglers\" na tagasuporta o mismong miyembro ng Maute. \"Ginagalugad po natin lahat ng mga sulok-sulok, mga butas [at] tunnels. Sinisiguro po natin na hindi po nakatago dito ‘yong mga natitirang miyembro ng Maute-ISIS,\" ani Brawner. Lalo kasing napaigting ang paghahanap na ito matapos ipahayag ni Muhammad Ilham Syahputra, isang nadakip na teroristang Indonesian, na may lagpas 12 pang manlalaban ng Maute sa loob ng main battle area. Nahuli ng pulisya si Syahputra sa Barangay Loksadatu noong Miyerkoles, Nobyembre 1. Hahalughugin din ng mga eksperto ang cellphone na nakuha kay Syahputra sakaling may makalap ditong maaaring maging ebidensiya. \"Mayroon tayong mga forensic experts sa mga devices para makita kung sino ang mga kausap niya,\" ani Brawner. Nakuha kay Syahputra ang mga alahas at pera mula sa iba't ibang bansa gaya ng US dollars, Saudi riyal, at Indonesian rupiah. 'Professional looters,' nahuli Dagdag ni Brawner, patuloy na iniimbestigahan ang mga sundalong inaakusahan ng looting, o pagtangay ng mga gamit, nang madestino sa Marawi. Nasa 22 \"professional looters\" din umano ang nahuli kamakailan at kinasuhan na ng pulisya. Sa gabi umano nananalisi ang mga ito upang magnakaw sa lungsod.

    "timestamp": "Nov 02 2017 04:15 PM",
    "content": "MANILA - Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said he is eyeing a “better looking” millennial to help him carry out the critical task of speaking on behalf of President Rodrigo Duterte. Roque, 51, said he wants a deputy spokesperson younger than him to convey the President's message to younger Filipinos.  He said he has picked for the job his former student at the University of the Philippines College of Law who is currently preparing for the bar examinations. He has yet to tell his chosen one but he is confident that he could persuade him to accept the offer. “I want a millennial. Number two, I want someone better-looking... than me so that the women will fall in love with him. And I want someone who speaks better than me. I promise the women, you will like the person I have in mind,” Roque said during his first news conference in Malacañang. “There’s always someone who should be able to give the Palace position on different issues, and I think I’m choosing this person because I want a link between a 72-year-old President and the millennials of today. You will not be disappointed with my choice.” Roque said he needs a deputy since he wants to do some of his work in war-torn Marawi City, where government is setting a rehabilitation program after its liberation from Islamic State-inspired terrorists. The city, once a bustling commercial and cultural capital, was ravaged by five months of firefights between state forces and Maute terrorists.  “It’s an innovation that I thought of because the rebuilding is soon to begin and I think the people should know exactly what’s happening on the ground,” he said. “That’s why it’s going to be very difficult for me to be flying to Marawi every Tuesday evening. It’s a very long drive from Cagayan de Oro. It’s very complicated for security reasons and logistic reasons but I want to do that because I want to bring Malacañang to areas where, you know, attention should be devoted.” Roque, meanwhile, said he has no immediate plans of reorganizing the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson. “I’m not going to reinvent the wheel ‘no dahil naririyan na ‘yung karamihan sa kanila. I’m sure they can stay. And I will repeat what I have said: No one will lose their jobs because it’s Christmas. If there will be individuals that will be let go, we will wait until after Christmas and as I said, I would want to take advantage of the experience of people who are already here,” he said. “But please understand that as a Cabinet post, I also need to bring in people whom I can completely trust. And that’s the only reason why I’m bringing in new personalities.”",

    "title": "Lawyers launch 'Manlaban' to fight EJKs",
    "timestamp": "Nov 02 2017 04:13 PM",
    "content": "MANILA (UPDATED) - Constitutionalists, human rights lawyers and several associations of law students launched on Thursday the legal alliance \"Manlaban\" to coordinate different legal challenges to extra-judicial killings (EJKs) and other human rights violations under President Rodrigo Duterte. In a strongly worded statement, the Mga Manananggol Laban sa Extrajudicial Killings described the conduct of President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war as \"a blatant disregard of the right to life.\" \"Thousands of victims who are poor and powerless have been targeted and brutally, nay mercilessly, executed by the state, its agents and proxies with blatant contempt and disregard of due process,\" the group said.  The convenors include Sen. Rene Saguisag, the constitutionalist Dean Pacifico Agabin, Edre Olalia and Neri Colmenares of the National Union of People's Lawyers, Dean Jose Manuel Dioko of De La Salle University and chair of the Free Legal Assistance Group; former Ateneo School of Government Dean Antonio La Viña; Dean Ernesto Maceda Jr of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila; June Ambrosio, a well-known champion of women's and children's rights and head of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) National Center for Legal Aid; former congressman and human rights lawyer Erin Tañada; Roberto Cadiz of the Commission on Human Rights; professors Victoria Avena and Roel Pulido, Rachel Pastores of the Public Interest Law Center; Evalyn Ursua and Cleto Villacorta III. Aside from their individual and organizational legal service programs, the group is pushing the advocacy for human rights by holding forums nationwide and helping in the training of paralegal volunteers. “We have never had a greater need for paralegal aid,” said La Viña. The group’s advocacy goes beyond the alleged 12,000 killings since the start of President Rodrigo Duterte’s crackdown on drug users and sellers, to include all other extra-judicial killings, threats to freedom of expression and attacks against human rights defenders.  The Duterte administration has repeatedly said the 12,000 figure is wrong and exaggerated. It has insisted that the \"real\" figure is 3,967 \"drug personalities\" killed (from July 1, 2016 to October 25, 2017) in presumed-legitimate anti-drug operations where the suspects violently fought back, prompting law enforcers to act in self-defense.  Olalia also cited the need to challenge an array of authoritarian tactics introduced by the Duterte government, including the police practice of conducting house-to-house drug tests and the use of intelligence “drop boxes” and surveys that violate privacy to boost the list of targeted drug users. “With violence on all fronts of President Duterte's ‘war’, there is deep fear indeed among the living that death will come, for virtually any one, sooner, at the door,” Manlaban said.\n \nIt rejected Duterte’s oft-repeated claim that he first needs to wipe out the tentacles of narcotics gangs at the grassroots.\n \n“Extrajudicial killings have not worked before and will never work now,” Manlaban stressed.\n \n“The effective solution to the drug problem in the Philippines is cleaning up government of officials, including the police and politicians, who protect drug syndicates, effective prosecution of all involved, especially big drug lords, to dry up the supply chain, and inclusive economic development to uplift the people from penury and thus stem the demand for antisocial vices like drugs.” The lawyers dismissed as a myth the government's claim that its conduct of the drug war has popular support from Filipinos. All Filipinos should support a campaign against drugs, said La Viña.  But, he pointed out, surveys consistently show that majority of Filipinos are concerned about extra-judicial killings, scared that they could also fall victim, and believe that Duterte's campaign largely targets poor citizens. \"It is clear that there is no approval of its conduct,\" he said.  The lawyers stressed Manlaban’s non-partisan character and urged Filipinos to reject the government stance of equating dissent with destabilization. “Human rights has no color,” Tañada said in response to a question about Duterte’s claim of a “Yellow-Red” conspiracy. “Human rights are for everyone,” said La Viña. “We come from different political strains. We do not fear these accusations.” “Our records speak for us,” said Olalia, adding that the group’s members have consistently fought for human rights since the rule of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Last month, President Duterte ordered Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) to take the lead in the anti-drug campaign and placed the Philippine National Police (PNP) at the back seat after he suffered a third-quarter drop in his net satisfaction ratings, which analysts linked to his bloody war on drugs.  'PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY'  Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque Jr., meanwhile, said the Palace respects the decision of the lawyers to organize themselves into a group, but he noted that police operations must be accorded presumption of regularity. “But as far as extra-legal killings is concerned, I came to this job knowing fully well the official position of the President, which he made public after the killing of Kian ‘no,” Roque said, referring to Duterte’s condemnation of the killing of teenager Kian delos Santos by Caloocan cops.  “He will not tolerate murders. He will only tolerate killings when it is in line with duty and when the engagement is legal and he had, in fact, asked that the police officers involved in the Kian killing be arrested by [Philippine National Police chief] General Bato [Dela Rosa].”",

    "content": "MANILA – Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said he is not yet resigning from his post as Kabayan Party-list Representative as he has yet to receive his appointment paper. Roque, who shall hold the rank of a Cabinet secretary, said he was advised by some colleagues in the chamber to wait for his appointment paper and seek clarification whether he would need to hurdle the bicameral Commission on Appointments (CA). “I was given the advice though by some of my colleagues like Cong. Rodolfo Albano [that] unless you’re certain that you’re not going through the CA, don’t resign until you’re sure that one, you will not go through the CA, and if you do that, the CA had already confirmed you,” Roque told ANC. Roque cited the case of former Las Piñas Representative and now Public Works Secretary Mark Villar, who waited for his confirmation from the CA before relinquishing his post as a lawmaker. “I can assume (the position as a spokesperson) without resigning, and that works for me right now as Congress is still on recess anyway,” Roque said. Congress will resume its session on Nov. 20, while Roque is set to formally assume his post on Nov. 6, the day he will also attend his first Cabinet meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte. In a related development, Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, who sits as chairman of the powerful CA, said there is no need for Roque to go through the bicameral body. Roque, meanwhile, said that aside from being the President’s spokesperson, he may also take on another role. He said he may also serve as an adviser of the Chief Executive on a particular issue, which he did not reveal. “It’s just an advisory position that would not be incompatible with the Cabinet appointment,” he said in a news conference in Malacañang. Some analysts have said Roque, an expert on international law, may be tapped for President Rodrigo Duterte's defense in the case filed against him before the International Criminal Court (ICC) over his alleged involvement in extrajudicial killings. Roque is the only Filipino lawyer who may practice law before the ICC.  On Monday, Roque said this would be up to the President.  In January, Kabayan Party-list \"removed\" Roque as its representative over loss of trust and confidence, citing his media statements accusing state lawyers of corruption.  The party said Roque was removed due to \"an overwhelming call among Kabayan Party-list members and supporters,\" and that his actions were \"severely damaging\" to the party-list. Despite this, Roque was not readily removed from his post as the review of his status remained pending before the House leadership. He has pending ethics cases against the group's second nominee Ron Salo, who had filed a disbarment case against him before the Supreme Court. ",

Roque, a human rights lawyer prior to becoming a lawmaker, previously said he can use his being a spokesperson to bring up human rights issues with Duterte and other government officials, especially those involved in the war on drugs, the administration of justice, and protection of human rights.

    "content": "MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte has tapped Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) chairperson Eduardo del Rosario as the new head of Task Force Bangon Marawi, as the government focuses on rebuilding the war-torn city of Marawi. Duterte’s Administrative Order No. 9 changes the composition of the task force, which was previously headed by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana. The task force was created on June 28 through AO No. 3 \"There is a need to reorganize Task Force Bangon Marawi in order to reflect the government’s current priority to rebuild and develop the settlement areas affected by the armed conflict,\" Duterte’s AO No. 9 reads. Del Rosario shall be assisted by the secretaries of defense and public works who will both serve as vice-chairpersons of the task force. \"The Chairperson of the HUDCC as head of Task Force Bangon Marawi shall have operational control and supervision of the said Task Force and the overall responsibility to ensure that the objectives of this order are accomplished,” the order reads. The administrative order also makes Del Rosario as head of the sub-committee on housing and subcommittee on security, peace and order, previously headed by the Cabinet Secretary and Interior Secretary, respectively. The government is gearing up for the task of building back Marawi City after the end of hostilities last week. The conflict left much of the former commercial center in ruins and displaced more than 200,000 residents. At least 1,100 were killed, most of them terrorists. Temporary shelters for displaced families will be ready by December, the government promised, as authorities continued to clear the city of stray explosives. Government has allotted P5 billion for the city's rehabilitation this year, while another P10 billion is set to be released next year. Lorenzana earlier said rebuilding the city may need up to P50 billion. Earlier, the Office of the Civil Defense said rebuilding Marawi City may take 2 to 3 years.",

    "title": "New spokesman says no evidence Duterte ordered killings",
    "timestamp": "Nov 02 2017 10:16 AM",
    "content": "MANILA - Incoming Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Thursday he will not compromise his background as a human rights lawyer when he assumes the post. Roque, who represented the families of slain transgender Jennifer Laude and slain environmentalist Gerry Ortega, said there will be no compromise in his character when he becomes President Rodrigo Duterte's mouthpiece. \"Not at all. I probably would not have accepted this post had the President [not] clarified his position after Kian’s killing. But with the pronouncement of the President, he is completely in compliance with our state obligations on human rights, to protect and promote the right to life,\" he said in an interview with ANC's Headstart anchor Karen Davila. Duterte last week announced Roque's appointment, choosing the Kabayan Party-list Representative to replace Ernesto Abella, whom he had known for decades. Critics have questioned Roque's acceptance of the post as he would be joining an administration heavily criticized for alleged human rights abuses in the drug war. But Roque said he does not believe the President could have ordered summary killings. \"The perception is he’s behind the killings. I’m here to tell them as a lawyer, there’s no evidence that he ordered the killing and there’s no evidence that we’re in anyway in breach of our obligation to investigate and to prosecute,\" he said. The 51-year-old lawmaker said he will not change himself despite the new job, adding that he will never become an apologist for the President because the Chief Executive's marching order was simple: \"Do not lie.\" \"It’s too late for me to change. It’s too late for me to become a different person. I would remain who I am. My convictions will remain the same,\" he said. \"I take on a job and I take on a job with a purpose. I want to put the communication of the President in the proper legal context and I want to be instrumental in making history in this country, not just a witness to history in this country,\" he added. Roque, who has voted against the death penalty in the House of Representatives and is vocal in his opposition to lowering the age of criminal liability, said he will only speak of the President's stance on these pet measures and not his. \"I will be (a) spokesperson. I will have to mouth the President’s positions on these issues. So I will say, the President supports the death penalty. Is that my personal belief? No, and people know it because of my voting record in the House,\" he said. \"It’s not my business to argue about the policies of the President. My business is to restate the policy of the President and to provide the correct legal context in case he is not understood,\" he said. He said he accepted the position as the spokesperson to take advantage of the opportunity to call the police and inquire about the progress on the the investigation and prosecution of the perpetrators. \"Maybe that’s why God said we should give you this opportunity because that’s the most active and most effective manner in which I can contribute to solving one of our problems, the problem of killings,\" he said.",

Nagawa pang makagapang ni Barrida papasok ng kuwarto pero sinundan pa siya ng isa sa mga salarin at pinagbabaril ulit. Dito na siya tinamaan ng dalawang bala sa magkabilang hita. Agad na dinala sa pagamutan si Barrida habang ligtas naman ang kanyang pamangkin at live-in partner na nakapagtago sa loob ng bahay. Naglatag naman agad ng checkpoint malapit sa lugar ang awtoridad. Ayon sa pulisya, posibleng may kinalaman sa trabaho o personal na problema ang insidente. Sinabi ni Chief Inspector Joeven Arevalo, ang unang asawa ni Barrida ay nag-reklamo laban sa kanya pero tinitingnan pa nila kung may kaugnayan ito sa insidente. Isa pa sa tinitingnan nilang anggulo ay ang posibilidad na may kinalaman ito sa pagdukot sa dalawang magkapatid nitong nakaraang linggo kung saan ang mga suspek ay pawang armado din. Ang bahay ni Barrida ay malapit lamang sa tirahan ng dinukot na magkapatid. Si Barrida ay kasalukuyang naka-assign sa Headquarters Service Battalion ng 3rd Infantry Spearhead Division ng Philippine Army sa Jamindan, Capiz.",

    "timestamp": "Nov 02 2017 09:00 AM",
    "content": "MANILA - A former senator who authored the Anti-Hazing Law criticized fraternity brothers who said UST law freshman Horacio \"Atio\" Castillo III died of cardiac arrest or multiple organ failure, not hazing. According to former Senator Joey Lina, whether Castillo died of cardiac arrest or multiple organ failure is immaterial. He said proof that hazing occurred is enough to prosecute the suspects. \"That kind of defense is very lame. In short very, very weak. The law is clear: if there is hazing and if it is proven, and the person hazed died or suffered physical injuries, there is a penalty,\" he told ANC Thursday. Arvin Balag, the leader of Aegis Jvris fraternity, and his brod, John Paul Solano, both said in their counter-affidavits that Atio may have died of a pre-existing heart disease, and not hazing. They both pointed out that Castillo had a condition that increases the risk of heart failure. Horacio Castillo Jr., the victim's father, meanwhile refuted these claims, saying \"blunt trauma\" caused his son's death. Lina believes the prosecution has enough evidence to prove hazing happened. He said hematoma on Atio's body, the paddles in the Aegis Jvirs library, and DNA samples will make for a strong case. The former lawmaker also said the evidence corroborates the testimony of Mark Ventura, who claimed that he was present during the initiation that led to Atio's death. \"All of these taken together at this stage in time will build a strong case against the perpetrators,\" said Lina.",

Operators of Palm Concepcion Power Corporation admitted they encountered a mechanical problem while the power plant was undergoing maintenance. Residents later returned to their homes, but they complained the ash residue made them sick and covered their houses. One of the residents, Delia Jaspe, experienced chest pain after inhaling fly ash. Some were brought to the rural health center for check-up. The leak reportedly took place last Oct. 30 when residents saw clouds of smoke rising above from the power plant. Engr. Martin Tambien, plant manager of Palm Concepcion Power Corporation, told ABS-CBN News they started cleaning up and repairing the facility last Oct. 22 as part of their annual preventive maintenance. He said their filtration device where the fly ash was processed for disposal ran into a problem that led to the leak. Tambien said they managed to troubleshoot the electrostatic precipitator in 30 minutes. Residents told ABS-CBN News they will bring their concern to the municipal government and and demand compensation from the power plant for the leak.",

Bukod sa iba pang pangulo na nakahimlay sa LNMB, may bulaklak din na ipinadala si Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte kay Marcos. Sabi ni Bongbong, karaniwan para sa isang pangulo na bigyan ng bulaklak ang lahat ng mga yumaong dating pangulo bilang pag-alala sa kanilang serbisyo sa bansa. Matinding pagtutol at talakayan mula sa publiko ang sumalubong sa halos sinikretong libing noon. Kinuwestiyon din ang administrasyong Duterte kung bakit pinayagang malibing ang isa umanong diktador at dating human rights violator sa himalayan ng mga itinuturing na bayani ng bansa. -- Ulat ni Ron Gagalac, ABS-CBN News",

May bagyo o ulan, [nan]dito kami,\" pahayag ni Grace. Mababa rin ang bilang ng mga nagsipuntahan sa Manila Memorial Park ngayong taon. Nagdulot ng perhuwisyo ang ulan dahil naging maputik ang mga puntod.

    "content": "TAIPEI—The first plane from Manila landed in Taipei on Wednesday as Taiwan commenced a trial 9-month visa-free travel regime for visitors from the Philippines. Among its passengers was a Filipino media crew invited by the Taipei city government to taste local delicacies and visit tourist attractions in the capital city. Sig Aldeen, a blogger and television host making his first-ever visit to Taiwan, said he never had Taiwanese cuisine before. After tasting Taiwanese hamburger and stinky tofu, he said their very distinct flavors impressed him. The media workers were welcomed by Taipei's Deputy Mayor Chen Chin-jun, who said he hopes they enjoy their stay in Taiwan and will help to promote the island's tourist attractions and food after they return to the Philippines. Statistics show that more than 200,000 visitors came to Taiwan from the Philippines from January to September this year, a 70 percent increase compared with the same period last year. The Manila Economic and Culture Office, the Philippines' de facto embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, welcomed the Taiwanese government's decision to grant visa-free entry to Filipinos for up to two weeks for tourism, business, visiting relatives and other purposes. Its Deputy Representative Carlo Aquino told Kyodo News that he expects the program will \"open the floodgates for Filipinos who wish to visit Taiwan as tourists but were stymied by the stringent visa requirements imposed by the Taiwan office in Manila before the adoption of the new policy.\" The program is partly aimed at advancing the government's \"New Southbound Policy\" that covers the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, six South Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand. It hopes visitors from those countries could offset a significant slump in tourists from mainland China, which had displaced Japan as the largest source of visitors in 2010. There has already been a significant increase in visitors from ASEAN countries since Taiwan relaxed visa rules for them in August last year. Over 200 million of them came during the year before that, up from about 1.5 million the previous year. Malaysians and Singaporeans already enjoy full-fledged 30-day visa-free entry to Taiwan, while the same applies to passport holders from Brunei and Thailand during a trial period lasting until July 31 next year.",

The late Mayor Parojinog, his wife Susan, his brother Octavio, and sister Mona were laid to rest in their mausoleum at the Mt. Malindang Memorial Garden. The first to visit on All Saints' Day is Aldong’s sister Aida Vasquez. She said they used to celebrate their mother’s birthday every November 1 but now, it’s different.  “The pain is still here, still so fresh,” she said. Supporters of the family also dropped by to light candles and offered prayers for the family. Former city councilor Roger Regalado brought flowers and lit candles for the late mayor.  “We really could not forget what happened. We want to remember the mayor’s contribution in Ozamiz,” he said. Mayor Parojinog and his kin were among 16 people killed last July 30, when their family's security personnel allegedly fought policemen who were supposed to serve search warrants. The same operation led to the arrest of Ozamiz Vice Mayor Nova Princess Parojinog and her brother Reynaldo Jr. following the alleged discovery of half a kilo of shabu in their home. Police and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) have launched separate probes into the bloody operation against Ozamiz's top political clan amid the Duterte administration's war on drugs.",

    "content": "LONDON—At least 15 million teenage girls worldwide have been forced into sex — often by partners, relatives or friends — yet only one in 100 sought help, the United Nations said on Wednesday. Cameroon had the highest rate of sexual violence, with one in six teenage girls experiencing forced sex, the U.N.'s children's agency (UNICEF) said in a report which examined data from more than 40 countries. \"This idea of women being at the disposal of men is a big factor driving the experience of sexual violence of girls,\" report author Claudia Cappa told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In the majority of cases, the abuser was known to the victim - with acts of sexual violence carried out by husbands, boyfriends, family members, friends and classmates. UNICEF said widespread sexual violence against teenage girls could hinder global progress towards achieving the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - a plan to end poverty, hunger, achieve gender equality and protect the planet by 2030. The number of girls who have been forced to have sex is likely to be far higher than 15 million as many are reluctant to come forward and data is lacking in many countries, it said. Abuses ranged from child sexual exploitation in the Dominican Republic's tourism industry to online sexual abuse in the Philippines. The report also highlighted projects to combat violence, including self-defense classes in schools in Malawi. Better laws to protect children and more support from social services are vital to bring about change, UNICEF said. \"What has proved to be particularly successful has been working with governments to develop national action plans that try to bring together different sectors, such as education and the justice system,\" said Cappa. Prompted by sexual abuse allegations against American film mogul Harvey Weinstein, millions of women and girls around the world have been sharing their experiences of harassment and abuse on Facebook and Twitter with the hashtag #MeToo. Weinstein, accused by a number of women of sexual harassment and assault in incidents dating back to the 1980s, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Kinabig ko naman papunta dun tapos bigla tumalon dun,” aniya. Ayon sa mga residente, talagang madulas ang kalsada kahit maambon lang. Marami na rin daw ang naaksidente sa lugar. “Dapat ang gawin diyan hindi espalto dapat semento, madulas kasi espalto kung mabasa nang kaunti,” ani Sammy Bagtang, isang residente. Dahil sa aksidente, hindi nakapasok ang mga motorista sa lugar hanggang Miyekoles ng tanghali.",

Robredo said life and death has taken a new meaning for her since her husband's sudden passing in a plane crash in 2012. \"Yung pananaw na 'yung lahat temporary. Tingin ko to a certain extent mabuti din kasi parang pagpapaalala na yung nalalabing panahon parating pinagbubuti yung ginagawa kasi di mo alam kung kailan ka tatawagin [ng kamatayan],\" she told ABS-CBN News on Wednesday. (The perception that everything is temporary in a way is also good since it's a reminder to do good because you never know when your life will end.) The Vice President even revealed that she still keeps her husband's clothes and sometimes gets scolded by her mother. \"Parang pag minsan pinapagalitan ako ng nanay ko na 'Ano ba yan, after 5 years baka ang alikabok na niyan.' Di ko pa rin tinatanggal yung pantalon niya, yung shorts niyang naiwan, pati yung mga damit niya sa cabinet parang di ko pa malet go,\" she shared.  (Sometimes I get scolded by my mother...I still keep his pants, shorts and his clothes in the cabinet. I can't seem to let go.) She noted that a priest has already assured her that she will move on when she is ready. \"Marami pa ring gamit [si Jesse] na di ko magalaw... it will take time, dadating din yun..\" she said. (I still can't seem to move a lot of Jesse's things.) -- With reports from Mylce Mella",

The company found an approximately 3-centimeter-long wire in a banana during a voluntary inspection at its facility in the city of Kawasaki on Friday. The company reported the incident to local police, believing someone in the Philippines inserted the wire into the banana. The fruit subject to recall is being sold at supermarkets and greengrocers across Japan. In a second instance of possible food tampering, Dole Japan received a complaint on Monday over the phone from a consumer in Aichi Prefecture who said a piece of wire was discovered when eating a banana.

    "content": "MANILA - Hundreds of Filipinos heard mass in Rome over the weekend to promote the cause for the sainthood of the late Ilocano Bishop Alfredo Florentin Verzosa. A crowd of Filipino migrants, mostly Ilocanos, attended a mass on Oct. 29 presided by Nueva Segovia Archbishop Emeritus Ernesto Salgado to promote the cause for Verzosa's beatification and canonization, said a report by CBCP News. The mass was held at the Church of Santa Maria Addolorata at the Piazza Buenos Aires in Rome, Italy. Priests, mostly chaplains of Filipino Catholic migrant communities in Europe, concelebrated the Mass. CBCP News also reported that the Missionary Catechists of the Sacred Heart and the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia are promoting the cause to sainthood as part of the celebration of Verzosa’s episcopal consecration centenary this year. The cause for Verzosa's beatification was opened in his native Vigan in 2013. The diocesan inquiry finished on April 2 last year, and the official report or positio is set to be reviewed \"by a team of historians, theologians and, eventually, by some cardinals,\" CBCP News said.  If affirmed, the cause will be elevated to the Pope for the declaration of the “venerable,\" or one worthy of veneration. To be canonized a saint, there should be at least two confirmed miracles attributed to the \"venerable\" after his or her death. As a priest, Verzosa fought for the preservation of Roman Catholicism amid the Aglipayan schism at the onset of the 20th century. He was also the bishop of Lipa, Batangas during the so-called \"miracle of roses\" or the shower of petals during a reported apparition in 1949, which the Vatican later declared \"not worthy of belief.\" The Vatican later clarified that the said \"miracle\" was simply an event in Verzosa's life and is not the main concern and purpose of the beatification cause. Verzosa died on June 27, 1954 in his hometown. There are currently two Filipinos canonized as saints: San Lorenzo Ruiz, canonized in 1987, and San Pedro Calungsod, canonized in 2012. ",

Noel Del Prado ang disinterment o paglipat ng isang bangkay sa ibang libingan. Nakapaloob ang mga patakaran ukol sa disinterment sa Presidential Decree No. 856 o 'Code on Sanitation.'  Ayon sa batas, kinakailangang makakuha ng permiso mula sa lokal na pamahalaan upang ipalipat ang bangkay. Ito'y idudulog pa sa city o municipal health office. Paliwanag ni Del Prado, health officer ang mangangasiwa upang matiyak na walang pahamak na maidudulot sa kalusugan ng publiko ang paglipat sa bangkay. \"Ang layunin ng Code of Sanitation [ay] mapangalagaan ang kalusugan ... hindi lamang [ng mga] naiwan ng kanilang mahal sa buhay, kundi ‘yong buong pamayanan,\" ani Del Prado. Dalawang permit ang ipakukuha: sa lokal na pamahaalan ng kasalukuyang libingan, at sa lokal na pamahalaan ng paglilipatan. Ibig sabihin, kung nakalibing ang bangkay sa San Juan, halimbawa, at ililipat ito sa Maynila, kinakailangang kumuha ng permit sa mga health office ng parehong lugar. \"Bawat lipat niyan (bangkay), pagkilos, may pahintulot sa apektadong LGU (local government unit),\" ani Del Prado. Maaaring ilipat ng libingan ang yumao matapos ang tatlong taong pagkakalibing. Kung delikado at nakahahawang sakit naman ang ikinamatay ng bangkay, kinakailangan ng limang taong pagkakalibing bago ilipat ang bangkay. Sa ilalim ng batas, dapat disimpektahin ang bangkay o mga labi na ililipat bago ilagay sa matibay at mahigpit na sinarang sisidlan. Bahagi ang talakayan sa serye ng Usapang De Campanilla ngayong Undas 2017 na magbigay ng karagdagang kaalaman ukol sa mga batas na may kaugnayan sa pagpapalibing.",

Noel Del Prado sa programang \"Usapang De Campanilla\" ng DZMM.  \"Walang libing na maaaring gawin nang hindi doon sa itinakda ng batas,\" ani Del Prado. Ayon sa batas, pangunahing pangangailangan sa pagpapalibing ang death certificate, na maaaring kuhanin ng kaanak sa doktor ng pumanaw. Ito'y upang mabigyan ng patotohanan ang pagkamatay ng indibidwal. \"Siya (doktor) ang magsesertipika na patay na talaga ‘yong tao at ilalagay din doon (certificate) ang oras [at sanhi] ng kaniyang kamatayan,\" ani Del Prado. Itinakda rin ng Sanitation Code na dapat isa't kalahating metro ang lalim ng paglilibangan. Ayon kay Del Prado, dapat ang paglilibingan ay siksik at matatag. \"Hindi ‘yong ‘pag nilagyan ng tubig, guguho ‘yong lupa,\" aniya. Awtopsiya, may 'foul play'? Sa ilalim ng batas, ang mga taong may karapatan sa bangkay lamang ang makapagbibigay ng pahintulot upang sumailalim ito sa awtopsiya o pagsusuri. \"As a general rule, sila (may karapatan sa bangkay) ‘yong masusunod so puwede nila ipa-autopsy, puwede silang tumanggi,\" paliwanag ni Del Prado. Kung balak ipasuri, dapat itong ipagbigay-alam agad sa mga lokal na awtoridad.  Ngunit puwedeng ibang tao rin ang humiling ng awtopsiya, lalo na kung may palatandaan ng \"foul play\".  Maaaring ihain sa piskalya ang hiling na awtopsiya sa bangkay lalo na kung kahina-hinala ang pagkamatay nito. \"Nangingibabaw dito ‘yong mas mataas na, kumbaga sa sistema ng ating batas, ‘yong pinahahalagahan ng batas, ‘yong katotohanan at katarungan,\" ani Del Prado. Ipinag-uutos din ng batas na dapat ilibing sa loob ng 48 oras matapos mamatay ang isang bangkay na hindi pa naembalsamo. Kapag ang sanhi naman ng pagkamatay ay nakahahawang sakit, dapat ilibing sa loob ng 12 oras matapos mamatay ang bangkay.  Hindi rin ilalantad sa publiko ang bangkay at tanging mga nakatatandang miyembro ng pamilya ang papayagang makadalo sa libing.

The Indonesian identified as Muhammadin Ilham Syaputra was arrested by police because he did not look like one of the locals and was seen with his clothes drenched after swimming across the Lanao Lake from Marawi City to nearby Barangay Loksadatu. \"When he was caught, basa 'yung ano niya (damit). He was carrying something in his bag. May baril, grenade, at pera na Philippine, Indonesian, at Malaysian (sa bag niya),\" Senior Supt. John Guyguyon, acting chief of the Lanao del Sur Provincial Police Office, said in a press conference. Guyguyon said they have yet to determine the amount of cash confiscated from the terror suspect. He said the suspect's cellphone will be sent to Manila to check its call and message logs. \"Isa lang siya sa mga leg workers. According to him, nag-iintel (siya). He has a bullet wound sa may side. He is claiming that he shot one of his Indonesian allies because he wants to escape Marawi,\" Guyguyon said. Indonesian passports were also retrieved from the suspect.\n \nGuyguyon said police are coordinating with the Bureau of Immigration to verify if the suspect and his other alleged Indonesian cohorts who sympathized with the Maute group entered the country via the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Cases will be filed against the Indonesian national to prevent him from leaving the country, Guyguyon said. Military officials said Syaputra is claiming that there are still dozens of Maute terrorists in Marawi City, but Joint Task Force Ranao Deputy Commander Romeo Brawner Jr. sees no need to reactivate combat operations in the war-torn city. Government declared the end of hostilities in Marawi City on Oct. 23, exactly five months since firefights erupted between state troops and Islamic State-linked Maute terrorists. Foreign terrorists were known to have fought alongside local extremists during the conflict. At least 1,100 people, most of them terrorists, were killed and more than 200,000 Marawi City residents were displaced during the crisis. Government has begun planning the city's rehabilitation.",

The Marcos family on Wednesday held a mass near the tomb of the late strongman who hurriedly buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City last year. Bongbong Marcos, son of the late strongman, said the event is highly significant for their family. \"Mabuti naman at hanggang ngayon ay naalala pa ang kaniyang mga naitulong at nagawa para sa bansa sa panahon na siya'y buhay pa at nagseserbisyo,\" he said. (It's good that until now people still remember his service to the country when he was still alive.) \"I remember the moments of greatness during his presidency but also the moments of intimacy.

    "timestamp": "November 2, 2017 - 7:52pm",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — When in Asia, make sure handshakes aren't too long—or short. Don't bobble names or titles. Stifle the critical tweets and don't question the food.\nThese key points of etiquette and protocol are part of the region's core culture known as \"face\"—keeping yours, helping others save theirs. And they are in many ways the opposite of President Donald Trump's impulsive, in-your-face style.\nTrump departs Friday on a 10-day visit to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. He'll be toting a hefty economic and national security policy agenda, and—like any president—high stakes for his own standing on the global stage.\nBut before anyone gets to policy, there is protocol—the application of rules, etiquette and cultural norms for meetings between dignitaries. How are rooms set up? Are titles correct on the place cards? Who is sitting next to whom?\nAnd for the US president, which forms of American informality—pointing at someone with the index finger, for example—are deeply frowned upon?\n\"One of the things with protocol is obviously to do no harm,\" Sean P. Lawler, Trump's nominee to be to be US chief of protocol, said Wednesday before the Senate panel considering his confirmation. As the director of visits and diplomacy for the National Security Council, he will accompany Trump on the trip.\n\"One of my goals right off the bat,\" Lawler added, is to \"set the stage for diplomacy for the president.\"\nProtocol, an ancient discipline, is aimed at preventing surprises and embarrassment through careful planning and choreography.\n\"We are the bridge,\" said Capricia Marshall, President Barack Obama's chief of protocol from 2009 to 2013.Protocol experts say American informality frequently gets lost in translation in the traditional cultures Trump will be visiting.\nOn Wednesday, Trump showed signs of understanding the sensitivity. Even as he complained during a Cabinet meeting about \"bad\" trade deals and deficits, including with China, Trump was restrained.\n\"I don't want to embarrass anybody four days before I land in China,\" Trump said—before adding: \"But it's horrible.\"\nAmong the challenges Trump faces as he heads to Asia are the complexities of the \"Asian face,\" a concept that's foreign to many Americans but lies at the foundation of societies across the region.\nGenerally, it means making sure behavior, posture, gestures, remarks and more do not spark strong negative emotions in others, or oneself.\nSo, for example, Trump's 19 seconds of shaking, patting and yanking the hand of Japan's leader at the White House in February crossed all kinds of cultural lines. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe responded with an on-camera eye roll as Trump looked away. Trump is playing golf with Abe during the trip, according to White House officials.\nNames and titles are important in Asia.\nIn July, the Trump White House issued a news release that called Chinese President Xi Jinping the leader of \"the Republic of China.\" Xi is the president of the People's Republic of China. Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China. China said it received an apology from the US.\nThen there's Trump's fondness for using Twitter to respond to comments he doesn't like—\"bing, bing, bing,\" as he told Fox Business Network this month. In Asia, doing that in real time could offend the region's cultural aversion to confrontation.\n\"I think you will find that they are very sensitive to slights,\" said Georgetown University Professor Dennis Wilder, who formerly served on the National Security Council. He cautions Trump against \"any kind of tweeting\" that would criticize the leader of a country he's in. \"I think this can go well, but he just needs to understand that 'face' in East Asian cultures is terribly important and he needs to make sure that he gives 'face' to the other leaders.\"\nParticularly in China, a breach of protocol can affect the content of the meeting, according to Peter Selfridge, the most recent holder of the chief of protocol post, from 2013 to Trump's inauguration in January.\n\"The Chinese appreciate precision when it comes to formal diplomatic engagements,\" said Selfridge. \"Americans certainly welcome this as well, but are perhaps more accepting of improvisation and can even use it to their advantage.\"\nTrump wouldn't be the first US leader to commit a protocol faux pas in Asia.\nIn 2014, local bloggers huffed that Obama looked like an \"idler\" or a \"rapper\" when he turned down a chauffeured ride to the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in Beijing and arrived in his own, more-secure presidential limo—chewing gum—as he was known to do to fight nicotine cravings.\nTrump might consider advice from his predecessors if he finds he is served something other than his favorite steak with ketchup.\nRichard Nixon, the first president to open the diplomatic door to China, advised Ronald Reagan on a 1984 trip there: Don't ask about the food, just swallow it.\n\"Still, I had difficulty identifying several items on my plate that first night,\" Reagan wrote in his memoirs, \"so I stirred them around in hopes of camouflaging my reluctance to eat them.\"",

    "content": "BEIJING — Donald Trump vowed a more \"unpredictable\" foreign policy when he campaigned for president. Mission accomplished, if the mood in Asia ahead of his first presidential trip to the region is any indication.\nMuch like the prelude to a bruising typhoon, Trump's upcoming visit has inspired fear, resignation, indignation, morbid curiosity—even, according to one South Korean politician, feelings of national disgrace.\nDuring his first months as president, Trump, who will visit Japan, South Korea and China before attending regional summits in Vietnam and the Philippines, has blended moments of flattery with vows to rip up trade deals, destroy a sovereign nation with nuclear weapons and generally crash long-standing norms of diplomacy anywhere it suits his aims.\nHe has wined and dined the leaders of China and Japan, and been fawned over in return, and his shaky ties with South Korea's leader have led to worries that Washington could take military action against North Korea without Seoul's approval.\nLooming over his entire trip is one of the strangest relationships in the world—an often surreal exchange of threats of annihilation between North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Trump, who has also occasionally offered praise and dialogue.\nIt's something of a marvel then that despite Trump's unpredictability and the torpedoing of an Obama-era trade deal, there may actually be more continuity than change in Washington's Asia policy.\n\"People joke that Wagner's music is better than it sounds. The same can be said for Trump's Asia policy and relationships,\" longtime Asia analyst Ralph Cossa said, referring to the notoriously complex German composer.\n\"This will be put to the test when he goes to Asia, but I think the visit is likely to be more successful than many fear or predict.\"\nA look at some of the issues and leaders Trump will face during his trip, which begins when he arrives in Japan on Sunday:\nUnlike most of his recent predecessors, Trump will not visit the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone that looks out over North Korea.\nStill, his quarrel with the North's ruler will dominate the trip.\nAmid North Korean nuclear and missile tests and a standard barrage of belligerent rhetoric, Trump has veered from threats to unleash \"fire and fury\" on the North to calling Kim a \"pretty smart cookie\" and saying he'd be \"honored\" to talk, under the right circumstances.\nTrump's comments have caused both confusion and fears of war, especially in Japan and South Korea, but it is unclear how seriously to take declarations that don't appear to be policy pronouncements.\nNorth Korea accused Trump of openly pursuing what it called a \"crazy strategy.\" The state newspaper said in a commentary Thursday that the American president regards the strategy as a powerful means to advance his \"America first\" policy.\nTrump likes to say that a soft policy by his predecessor, Barack Obama, has allowed North Korea to stand on the brink of a viable arsenal of nuclear-armed missiles that can hit US mainland cities.\nDespite his criticism, Trump has yet to distinguish his own approach from Obama's, Bruce Klingner, a North Korea specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington, told US lawmakers in July.\n\"Trump's policy of 'maximum pressure' to date has been anything but,\" Klingner said, and sends mixed messages about whether Washington will pursue diplomacy or war to deal with Pyongyang.\nTrump's ties with South Korea's liberal president, Moon Jae-in, are causing some serious angst in the country.\nMoon took office in May with hopes of reaching out to Pyongyang. But a parade of North Korean missile and nuclear tests has forced him to take a harder line.\nWhile he has gone out of his way to emphasize coordination with Trump, a strain between the allies is evident.\nTrump has suggested that Seoul should pay the entire cost of a US missile defense system in the South that many there don't even want. He also threatened to end a hard-won US-South Korean free trade agreement that past American presidents had portrayed as an alliance bulwark.\nAmid dueling threats by Trump and Kim Jong Un, Moon has issued pointed reminders that there can be no US military action without Seoul's consent.\nSouth Koreans have long fretted about being pushed out of efforts to deal with the North—a fear so prevalent it has a name: \"Korea Passing.\" The headline on a recent editorial in the daily Dong-A Ilbo is telling: \"If Moon becomes Trump's 'friend,' Korea Passing will disappear.\"\nThere has also been anxiety that Trump will spend more time in both China and Japan than in South Korea on his trip.\nAhn Cheol-soo, a South Korean opposition politician, said recently that it's disappointing that Trump \"stays just briefly in South Korea, the country directly involved in the Korean Peninsula problem that has the rapt attention of the world. This feels really bad—our country has been disgraced.\"\nTrump won cheers during the presidential campaign by attacking China for allegedly stealing American jobs and failing to use its influence to stop ally North Korea's nuclear drive.\nBut as president, Trump has cozied up to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\"People say we have the best relationship of any president-president,\" Trump recently told Fox Business Network, referring to Xi, whom he called \n\"a very good person.\"\n\"Now, some people might call him the king of China. But he's called president,\" Trump said.\nTrump has, in some ways, been good for the ruling Chinese Communist Party, according to Robert Dujarric, an Asia expert at Temple University Japan, because he has raised global doubts about Washington by undermining institutions that serve US interests and impede those of China.\nTrump, for instance, pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal Obama negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim countries that was pitched, in part, as a way to counter China.\nDuring his trip, Trump may push China on trade barriers and to better implement U.N. sanctions on North Korea. But he can expect a royal reception in Beijing, including fawning press coverage and grand ceremonies aimed at boosting his impressions of Chinese power.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may be the Asian leader most confident in his relationship with Trump.\nHe was one of the first to pay court to President-elect Trump, eager to forge a bond with Tokyo's crucial ally. Trump, in turn, has raised an issue important to Abe: North Korea's past abductions of Japanese citizens.\nThere's worry in Tokyo about Trump's tough talk on trade, and the possibility that US military action against North Korea could endanger Japan. But Abe has generally avoided confronting Trump, at least in public.\nFrom golf to private dinners to an audience with the emperor, Trump's Japan \"visit is designed to not only offer visual evidence of the close partnership, but also to avoid any uncomfortable issues, such as trade,\" Daniel Sneider, an East Asia specialist at Stanford University, wrote recently.\nAbe's \"senior advisers claim to wield an influence over Trump that is the envy of other US allies,\" Sneider said. \"But that relationship depends on Abe consciously avoiding any challenge to Trump's policies. Does his influence disappear the moment he crosses Trump?\"",

    "timestamp": "November 2, 2017 - 7:16pm",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — In three exhaustive hearings this week, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google acknowledged that their platforms were used by Russia to try and create division over such disparate issues as immigration, gun control and politics.\nHouse investigators released a trove of Facebook and Twitter ads that showed just how extraordinary the cyber intrusion was.\nThe companies' admissions and disclosures gave congressional investigators one of their first real wins in the Russia probes. They have been frustrated by delays—and overshadowed by special counsel Robert Mueller—since they launched probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election earlier this year.\nInitially dismissive of Russia's threat, all three companies have pledged improvements since lawmakers ramped up pressure and called them to testify.\nIt's unclear what next steps Congress will take. The top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, has co-sponsored legislation that would bring political ad rules from TV, radio and print to the internet. Warner calls it \"the lightest touch possible,\" but many Republicans have been lukewarm.\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, said he thinks such advertising regulations for social media are \"inevitable,\" but noted that many of the fixes will come down to the companies' own social responsibility.\n\"Congress isn't going to prescribe an algorithm, so there are limits to what we can feasibly do,\" Schiff said after his committee's hearing Wednesday.\nThe few dozen ads, seen by vast sums of people, encouraged street demonstrations against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and fostered support and opposition to Bernie Sanders, Muslims, gays, blacks and the icons of the Civil Rights movement. The ads underscore how foreign agents sought to sow confusion, anger and discord among Americans through messages on hot-button topics.\nUS intelligence services said the Russian use of social media was part of a broad effort to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of Trump. Mueller is investigating whether the Kremlin worked with the Trump campaign to influence the election.\nMany of the ads also show careful targeting, with messages geared toward particular audiences. One ad, aimed at those with interests in civil rights and their leaders, highlights a man who claims to be Bill Clinton's illegitimate son. Another video parodying Trump was targeted at blacks who also are interested in BlackNews.com, HuffPost Politics or HuffPost Black Voices.\nIn preparation for hearings this week, Facebook disclosed that content generated by a Russian group, the Internet Research Agency, potentially reached as many as 126 million users. Company executives said that going forward they would verify political ad buyers in federal elections, requiring them to reveal correct names and locations. The site will also create new graphics where users can click on the ads and find out more about who's behind them.\nBut that did not prevent hours of questioning during two days of hearings, with lawmakers expressing exasperation at the seeming inability to thwart foreign intervention.\nAt one point, Sen. Al Franken put his head in his hands after he couldn't get all the companies to commit to not accepting political ads bought with foreign currency. Several ads touting Facebook pages called \"Back the Badge,\" \"Being Patriotic,\" \"Blacktivist,\" \"South United\" and \"Woke Blacks\" were labeled as being paid for in rubles using Qiwi, a Moscow-based payment provider that aims to serve \"the new generation in Russia\" and former Russian republics, according to the company's website.\n\"Google has all knowledge that man has ever developed,\" the Minnesota Democrat said. \"You can't put together rubles with a political ad and go like, 'Hmmm, those data points spell out something pretty bad?'\"\nBesides the ads released by lawmakers on the House intelligence committee, Democrats on the panel also released four tweets from RT, a Russian state-sponsored television network, and nearly 3,000 Twitter handles active during the final months of the election.\nTaken together, they show how actual news events and stories helped shape surreptitious Russian messaging.\nOne advertisement cited a real October 2016 news story—about a gunman's battle with Boston police officers—then used it to attack Hillary Clinton as \"the main hardliner against cops\" and to promote Trump as the candidate who can \"defend the police from terrorists.\"\nThree of the tweets referenced Clinton, including one that linked to an RT story about the release of a batch of hacked emails from her campaign chairman, John Podesta.\nSome 34,000 Trump supporters were shown an ad calling for Clinton's removal from the ballot, citing \"dynastic succession of the Clinton family\" as a breach of core principles laid out by the Founding Fathers. Clicking on it took Facebook users to a petition at WhiteHouse.gov.\nThough US intelligence officials believe the social media effort was aimed at aiding Trump, there are other indications it was intended to sow general divisions.\nOne ad promoted a Nov. 12 anti-Trump rally in New York City, titled \"Not My President.\" Large anti-Trump rallies actually did take place around the country that day in major American cities. That doesn't mean the Russian accounts planned the events, but rather that they were piggybacking on existing protests and promoting them to like-minded people.",

    "timestamp": "November 2, 2017 - 7:13pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines (Updated 8:05 p.m.) — The Philippines continues to bolster its military despite President Rodrigo Duterte's move to improve relations with China, a defense analyst said. According to Alexander Vuving of the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies, the build-up of Philippine military forces has hit a plateau between 2007 and 2012 when military spending remained the same. The standoff between the Philippines and China over Scarborough Shoal, 120 nautical miles off Manila's coast, from April to June 2012 led the government to jack up military expenditure by 136 percent between that year and 2016. The United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines invalidating China's nine-dash line claim over the South China Sea. \"It is noteworthy that President Duterte’s about-face regarding the 2016 South China Sea rulings and his pivot to China do not significantly affect the Philippines’ force modernization,\" Vuving said. \"The 2012 standoff with China over the Scarborough Shoal may prove to be a watershed in the evolution of the Philippine strategic culture, reverting a decade-long neglect of the air force, navy, and coast guard,\" he added. READ:   South China Sea: Beyond the Hague ruling Manila's reliance on the United States for its external defense and its focus on internal threats, such as Muslim and Maoist insurgencies, have resulted in the \"chronic neglect\" of its navy, air force and coast guard, according to Vuving. Past attempts at modernization, he said, have failed due to economic problems and lack of funds. In 1995, the Philippines passed a law calling for the modernization of the AFP following China's occupation of Mischief Reef, which exposed its lack of capability to protect its territory. However, this plan was halted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. \"A Capability Upgrade Program to implement the AFP Modernization Act of 1995 was constantly underfunded although it was reprioritized in 2005,\" he said. The extension of the AFP modernization program was taken as one of the priority pieces of legislation in the Philippine Development Plan 2011-216, he said. READ:  Tribunal ruling: Blunting China’s realpolitik approach in the South China Sea dispute The 2012 Scarborough standoff was what accelerated the upgrade of the AFP. \"The standoff with China at Scarborough Shoal between April and June 2012 led to China’s de facto control of the reef and its surrounding waters,\" Vuving said. \"This prompted Manila again to pass, in late 2012, a new law (Republic Act 10349) that renews and accelerates the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces.\" In recent years, the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Air Force have each launched programs to acquire military hardware to beef up their long-neglected fleets. The Philippine Air Force launched a modernization plan titled, \"Fight Plan 2028,\" in 2014 which would see the PAF addressing incursions between 50 to 75 percent of the territory by 2020 and the entire Exclusive Economic Zone by 2028. \"This appears to be extremely ambitious, as the Philippines possesses only 12 FA-50PHs in 2017. The PAF has plans to acquire six more FA-50PHs and 12 multi-role fighters capable of air superiority,\" Vuving said, noting that the PAF became combat-capable again only in 2015 after losing its air fighting capacity in 2002. READ: Palawan within range of China's jets, missiles in South China Sea  The Navy, whose ships are either four decades old or operative since World War II, meanwhile launched a modernization plan called, \"Strategic Sail Plan 2020,\" which aimed to procure up to six frigates, 12 corvettes, 18 offshore patrol vessels and three anti-mine ships. It also targeted the acquisition of strategic sealift vessels, landing craft, patrol gunboats, assault craft, maritime patrol aircraft, naval and utility helicopters, and submarines, Vuving said. \"The intention, indicated in 2011 and reiterated in 2013, was to acquire three diesel-electric submarines, possibly of the Kilo-class,\" Vuving said but noted that the Philippines was unlikely to acquire a submarine until 2025. READ:  Duterte hopeful China will stop expansion in disputed sea The Philippines also acquired two newly-built frigates in 2013 and awarded a contract worth $337 million to South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries for two ships that could displace 3,000 tons and could be equipped with anti-ship, anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons.  Through Japan's official development assistance, the Coast Guard procured 10 multi-role response vessels (MRRVs), and two 250-ton Parola-class MRRVs were delivered. \"In another program, the Philippines purchases five new-built vessels from France, including one 82-meter offshore patrol vessel (OPV) and four 24-meter fast patrol boats. The 1,400-ton OPV is expected to be delivered in 2018,\" he added. READ:  Shifting tactics: China advances 'four sha' claim in South China Sea The Philippines was also able to secure an agreement with Japan for Tokyo to build two high-endurance MRRVs during President Rodrigo Duterte's visit there in August 2016. The first one is expected to be delivered by November 2020 while the second one will be ready by March 2021, Vuving said. \"With these ships, the PCG will have 22 vessels larger than 100 tons with a total displacement of 7,700 tons by the end of 2018. This represents a 103 percent growth in tonnage and a 100 percent increase in number of ships during 2008-2018,\" Vuving added. ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — After conquering Mount Everest, Filipina adventurer Carina Dayondon is set to sail to China aboard a wooden replica of an ancient balangay in the hopes of boosting national pride in a forgotten maritime prowess.\nDayondon is planning to sail from Manila to southern China early next year, recreating trade and migration voyages made before Spaniards colonized the Philippines in the 1500s.\n\"People tell me I am crazy. They ask: 'Wow, why climb Mount Everest? Why go to China on this tiny thing,'\" Dayondon told Agence France-Presse in Manila Bay aboard one of the two boats that will make the expected six-day sailing journey.\n\"I'm excited because our team will be more inspired realizing how good our forefathers were. We have to let people know we should be proud of being Filipino,\" the 39-year-old added.\nDayondon, a petite but muscular Coast Guard officer, created history in 2007 when she and two other countrywomen became the first Filipinas to summit the world's highest mountain.\nArturo Valdez, who led their Everest support team, is also heading the sailing mission and similarly sees the journey to China as a chance to inspire Filipinos.\n\"Like Mount Everest, I want this to be symbolic of what our people can accomplish, of what can be possible out of the so-called impossible,\" the 69-year-old said.\nThe vessels are a copy of a \"balangay,\" which date back as far as 320 AD.\n\"Early trade with China and Southeast Asia was made possible by watercraft,\" Ligaya Lacsina, researcher at the National Museum's maritime division, told Agence France-Presse.\n\"Europeans during the colonial period were effusive in their praise of Southeast Asian boat-building skill. But somehow we've paid very little attention to this.\"\nTribal boat-builders from the southern Philippines, where the boats originated, have made the replicas of the balangay using skills passed on down the generations.\nThe boats, 18 meters (60 feet) long by three meters (10 feet) wide, are made of hardwood planks, include two sails, two rudders and a roofed area.\nTheir journey to the southeastern Chinese city of Quanzhou will be about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles), and the crew members are aiming to do it with as little modern technical help as possible.\n\"We have no night-sailing capability so we can be run over by a super tanker. That's my fear. The greatest difficulty of replicating an ancient voyage is modernity because there are new port protocols,\" Valdez said.\n\"This kind of boat is being treated as a maritime hazard.\"\nDaily life aboard the boat is a struggle, according to Dayondon.\n\"We sleep anywhere because we don't have quarters. We have no toilet. We just hold the rope and use a harness and do the proper position so we don't fall,\" she said.\nNevertheless, a third boat with a motor will accompany the balangays otherwise they will not be allowed into Chinese ports.\nTheir trip is planned to commemorate a journey made about 600 years ago by a sultan from the southern island of Sulu who went to China to pay tribute to Ming Dynasty rulers there but who but died of an illness on his way home.\nThe voyage to China will be the team's second maritime quest following a 17-month journey that began in 2009 around Southeast Asia.\nOne of the group's biggest challenges is off the water—finding enough money to fund the adventure.\nThe team members plan to open the vessels to the public for educational tours and even wedding shoots to raise money for their upkeep in Manila Bay.\nValdez, who also shepherded the first Philippine men up Mount Everest in 2006, said he hoped the government would financially back such feats but they had not.\n\"Filipinos love us when we climb Mount Everest, love us with our exploits but they are not willing to pay for that. And that makes us a poorer nation,\" he said.\n\"Blazing a trail and going beyond what is normal, that is the spirit of a nation. That is how you build a nation, out of a dream.\"",

    "timestamp": "November 2, 2017 - 6:26pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The bellwether index soared past the 8,500 territory for the first time on Thursday on the back of the US Federal Reserve’s positive view of US economy. The Philippine Stock Exchange index gained 150.76 points or 1.80 percent to 8,516.02—a fresh all-time high since the bourse closed to its previous best finish of 8,497.74 last October 17. The PSEi traded between a low of 8,321.65 to a high of 8,543.80 as trading resumes after a two-day holiday break. “Philippine markers traded into new territories once again as it made up for lost time with regional markets closing higher during our 2 day holiday. Economic data from several days was rather positive, which helped boost sentiment,” Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital Development said in a text message. The US Federal Open Market Committee maintained the funds rate target range at 1-1.25 percent at its November meeting, as widely expected. But according to Limlingan, the “main surprise” was the upgrade of the growth assessment to “a solid rate” from “rising moderately.” “The statement noted that this growth occurred ‘despite’ disruptions from the hurricanes, and it explicitly attributed the decline in September payroll employment to the storms,” Limlingan explained. “This return to a ‘solid’ pace of growth—last referenced in the January 2015 statement—underscores the Committee’s more positive view on real activity, following softness in parts of the economy over the last two years,” he added. The broader all-shares index rose 65.04 points or 1.33 percent to 4,956.97. Most of the counters were positive led by financials, which climbed 63.40 points or 3.17 percent to 2,064.46. Only the mining and oil counter declined on Thursday. Total value turnover amounted to P9.5 billion. Meanwhile, net foreign buying amounted to P758.47 million. Advancers trumped decliners at 116 to 79, while 47 issues closed flat. Leading the index’s rally was Megaworld, which went up by 6.94 percent, while Ayala Corp., the day’s most actively traded company, surged by 5.72 percent. On the other hand, cement-maker firm Cemex ended in the red, falling by 1.75 percent or 0.08 points to 4.49.",

    "title": "Philippines aims to improve ease of doing business by 2022",
    "timestamp": "November 2, 2017 - 6:23pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — In the face of intense competition among economies in providing better business climate, the Philippines is keeping its “ambitious” target in terms of ease of doing business after its latest global ranking dropped significantly despite its improved score. In the World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2018 report, the Philippines’ ranking plunged 14 notches to 113th from the previous 99th spot across 190 economies. The World Bank, however, said the current ranking is not comparable to the one published in the Doing Business 2017 report “because of methodology refinements.” READ: Phl drops in WB business rankings According to Trade Secretary and National Competitiveness Council chair Ramon Lopez, the government is still eyeing to reach the “top 20 percent” of 190 countries tracked by World Bank before President Rodrigo Duterte ends his term in 2022. “It’s an ambitious target but we will still try to do it,” Lopez told a press conference on Thursday. “It’s time to improve our target... parang aiming for the stars tayo,” he added. “In other words, achieving all those right number of procedures, right number of cost per capita—those targets are the ones we’ll seriously consider.” On the distance-to-frontier metric basis, the Philippines’ score saw a slight improvement as it went from 58.32 in Doing Business 2017 to 58.74 in Doing Business 2018. However, the country’s 2018 DTF was below the average of 62.7 across East Asia and Pacific economies. The DTF measures the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies, according to World Bank. Asked if it is “safe” to assume that the Philippines’ ranking will recover, NCC co-chairman for the private sector Bill Luz—who joined Lopez in the same news conference—said: “Nothing is safe because the other countries are also moving.” “The higher you move up, the competition will get tougher. We have to push the score,” Luz added. Meanwhile, for Lopez, the Philippines won’t pay much attention to rankings as the government focuses more on improving its score. “Ang importante satin actually ‘yung score natin will jump to... I think the highest now is somewhere to 70 plus to 80 plus. So ‘yon ‘yung target natin,” the trade chief said. “The ranking will be secondary because the bottomline, ‘yung score kasi reflects the ease of doing business na ini-implement natin,” he added. “If you hit the highest score, you’re up there in the ranking. But even without looking at the ranking, you know that you are providing ease of doing business.” According to the World Bank, the country stands out regionally in the Resolving Insolvency component, with a global rank of 59th. Over the past year, the report said the Philippines also implemented two key reforms to improve the business climate for small and medium enterprises. These are in the areas of getting electricity connection and paying taxes. Despite these continued reforms, however, the World Bank said small and medium-sized businesses still face significant regulatory challenges in the Philippines, leaving room for further improvements especially in the areas of starting a business, enforcing contracts and protecting minority investors. In a statement on Wednesday, the NCC said the impact of improvements introduced by the Duterte administration in the second half of 2016 “may not have been fully experienced yet” by the businessmen surveyed during the first five months of 2017. It also listed 10 priority projects that must be implemented to improve the country’s ranking. “Improving ease of doing business in the Philippines is an endeavor that involves the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of government. It is a whole-of-government effort,” the NCC said. Globally, New Zealand topped the Doing Business 2018 report, followed by Singapore, Denmark, Korea and Hong Kong. Completing the top 10 are the US, UK, Norway, Georgia and Sweden. The Doing Business report is an annual publication of the World Bank, which reviews regulations that enhance or constrain business activity.",

    "timestamp": "November 2, 2017 - 6:14pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Korean pop star Rain has canceled the “Rise 2 Shine” benefit concert slated November 3, Friday. According to its organizers, the musical event titled “Rise 2 Shine” at the Smart Araneta Coliseum would be rescheduled but the date has yet to be announced. The organizers are yet to provide an explanation behind the postponement of the event. Korean actor and performer Rain, whose real name is Jung Ji-hoon, was supposed to headline “Rise 2 Shine.” The concert would have been his return to the country after seven years. The concert is for the benefit of Marawi war victims, Make Your Nanay Proud Foundation and Ko-Ph World Foundation, which supports Filipino-Korean families and children. The organizers then apologized for the sudden rescheduling of the event and sought for the ticket holders’ understanding. “On behalf of the committee, we would like to apologize for this unforeseen situation all the performers will be the same,” the organizers said in its official statement. “We will keep you posted for the new schedule,” it added. Despite the organizers’ assurance that the event would be rescheduled with the same line-up of artists, Rain’s company issued a separate statement, saying that the Korean star would not participate in the benefit concert due to a contract issue. “As the organizer; KO- Ph. has been dishonest in fulfilling the performance contract, we have come to the decision that it is impossible to go ahead with the performance. Our decision is therefore 'not to participate in the performance',” Rain’s company said in a statement. “We hope to have the understanding of our fans, and we will pay more attention and do our best to avoid such happenings in the future,” it added. Other artists who were supposed to perform in the concert were Sam Concepcion, Isabelle de Leon, Kris Lawrence, Jay-R, Loisa Andalio, Krissha Viaje, Bendeatha, Pinoy Boyband Superstar, Miko Juarez and Gab Umali, Cursebox, Dasuri Choi and Jinho Bae.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – PBA commissioner Chito Narvasa leaves his fate in the hands of the PBA board of governors. Narvasa, however, will not go away yet, saying he’ll fight for the proper rules and procedures to be followed. Being eased out by seven PBA board members but called by five other PBA governors to stay on, Narvasa said he’s staying on until the board resolves a contentious issue in the league by-laws regarding terminating and hiring a PBA commissioner. “They’re all grown men. They will find a way. I hope that the board talks among themselves, and I want clarified on the matter, not for me, but for the future commissioners of the league,” said Narvasa. “I know that I’m here only temporarily, but as long as the issue isn’t resolved, I will not abandon the PBA which we all love, all the Filipinos love,” Narvasa also said. He said he’s heeding the call of his lawyers and the five PBA governors to fight for the procedures. “I’m willing to resign as I don’t need this. I don’t want enemies and I want the people in the PBA happy. I’m ready to sacrifice. But for principle, then I must stay,” he said. “The board must be able to determine what’s the right decision, what’s the right process, then come up with the right decision,” he added. He agrees with the stand of the SMC-led bloc “to fight for the Office of the Commissioner.” “What if they always bully someone that they don’t like, the Office of the Commissioner will weaken, and it would always be subject to who is the most powerful among team owners,” he said. “I’m fighting that nobody, however powerful they are, can frighten, threaten the Commissioner’s Office. It should be left alone.”  ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines (Updated 8:05 p.m.) — The Philippines continues to bolster its military despite President Rodrigo Duterte's move to improve relations with China, a defense analyst said. According to Alexander Vuving of the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies, the build-up of Philippine military forces has hit a plateau between 2007 and 2012 when military spending remained the same. The standoff between the Philippines and China over Scarborough Shoal, 120 nautical miles off Manila's coast, from April to June 2012 led the government to jack up military expenditure by 136 percent between that year and 2016. The United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines invalidating China's nine-dash line claim over the South China Sea. \"It is noteworthy that President Duterte’s about-face regarding the 2016 South China Sea rulings and his pivot to China do not significantly affect the Philippines’ force modernization,\" Vuving said. \"The 2012 standoff with China over the Scarborough Shoal may prove to be a watershed in the evolution of the Philippine strategic culture, reverting a decade-long neglect of the air force, navy, and coast guard,\" he added. READ:   South China Sea: Beyond the Hague ruling Manila's reliance on the United States for its external defense and its focus on internal threats, such as Muslim and Maoist insurgencies, have resulted in the \"chronic neglect\" of its navy, air force and coast guard, according to Vuving. Past attempts at modernization, he said, have failed due to economic problems and lack of funds. In 1995, the Philippines passed a law calling for the modernization of the AFP following China's occupation of Mischief Reef, which exposed its lack of capability to protect its territory. However, this plan was halted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. \"A Capability Upgrade Program to implement the AFP Modernization Act of 1995 was constantly underfunded although it was reprioritized in 2005,\" he said. The extension of the AFP modernization program was taken as one of the priority pieces of legislation in the Philippine Development Plan 2011-216, he said. READ:  Tribunal ruling: Blunting China’s realpolitik approach in the South China Sea dispute The 2012 Scarborough standoff was what accelerated the upgrade of the AFP. \"The standoff with China at Scarborough Shoal between April and June 2012 led to China’s de facto control of the reef and its surrounding waters,\" Vuving said. \"This prompted Manila again to pass, in late 2012, a new law (Republic Act 10349) that renews and accelerates the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces.\" In recent years, the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Air Force have each launched programs to acquire military hardware to beef up their long-neglected fleets. The Philippine Air Force launched a modernization plan titled, \"Fight Plan 2028,\" in 2014 which would see the PAF addressing incursions between 50 to 75 percent of the territory by 2020 and the entire Exclusive Economic Zone by 2028. \"This appears to be extremely ambitious, as the Philippines possesses only 12 FA-50PHs in 2017. The PAF has plans to acquire six more FA-50PHs and 12 multi-role fighters capable of air superiority,\" Vuving said, noting that the PAF became combat-capable again only in 2015 after losing its air fighting capacity in 2002. READ: Palawan within range of China's jets, missiles in South China Sea  The Navy, whose ships are either four decades old or operative since World War II, meanwhile launched a modernization plan called, \"Strategic Sail Plan 2020,\" which aimed to procure up to six frigates, 12 corvettes, 18 offshore patrol vessels and three anti-mine ships. It also targeted the acquisition of strategic sealift vessels, landing craft, patrol gunboats, assault craft, maritime patrol aircraft, naval and utility helicopters, and submarines, Vuving said. \"The intention, indicated in 2011 and reiterated in 2013, was to acquire three diesel-electric submarines, possibly of the Kilo-class,\" Vuving said but noted that the Philippines was unlikely to acquire a submarine until 2025. READ:  Duterte hopeful China will stop expansion in disputed sea The Philippines also acquired two newly-built frigates in 2013 and awarded a contract worth $337 million to South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries for two ships that could displace 3,000 tons and could be equipped with anti-ship, anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons.  Through Japan's official development assistance, the Coast Guard procured 10 multi-role response vessels (MRRVs), and two 250-ton Parola-class MRRVs were delivered. \"In another program, the Philippines purchases five new-built vessels from France, including one 82-meter offshore patrol vessel (OPV) and four 24-meter fast patrol boats. The 1,400-ton OPV is expected to be delivered in 2018,\" he added. READ:  Shifting tactics: China advances 'four sha' claim in South China Sea The Philippines was also able to secure an agreement with Japan for Tokyo to build two high-endurance MRRVs during President Rodrigo Duterte's visit there in August 2016. The first one is expected to be delivered by November 2020 while the second one will be ready by March 2021, Vuving said. \"With these ships, the PCG will have 22 vessels larger than 100 tons with a total displacement of 7,700 tons by the end of 2018. This represents a 103 percent growth in tonnage and a 100 percent increase in number of ships during 2008-2018,\" Vuving added. ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III ordered the Bureau of Customs to create interagency anti-smuggling task forces on the regional level to beef up the government's fight against the illegal entry of goods especially in the provinces. Dominguez said that the cooperation among the BOC, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and other relevant government agencies should go down to the regional level to ensure that provincial operations against illegal trading practices were coordinated. “We would like the cooperation between the BIR and the Customs to go down to the regional level.  They have to be meeting regularly on the regional level, not only in the national headquarters (in Manila),” Dominguez told Customs Commissioner Isidro Lapeña during a recent Finance executive committee meeting. READ:  ‘Shabu importer’ admits bribing Customs execs Dominguez emphasized that the BIR and BOC should be meeting regularly on the regional level, not just in the national headquarters in Manila. Considering that most of the illegally-traded goods that enter the country are sold in areas outside Metro Manila, Dominguez said anti-smuggling operations should be strengthened in the different regions of the Philippines. The finance chief cited the recent joint operation by the BIR and National Bureau of Investigation in a commercial establishment in Cabanatuan City which was found to be holding 480 master cases of illicitly-traded cigarettes. The BOC is currently embroiled in a massive smuggling controversy following the discovery that more than P6 billion worth of illegal drugs was able to enter Manila's ports despite the government's vaunted intensified anti-drug operations. READ:  Trader claims paying P92-M bribes to BOC The illegal drugs were later found in a warehouse in Valenzuela by agents of the BOC and the NBI. It was also revealed during a series of Senate hearings that corruption persisted at the BOC, with no less than former Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon being accused of accepting bribes running into millions of pesos upon assumption of the agency's leadership last year. Although he maintained his innocence, Faeldon resigned and was replaced by Lapeña who previously headed the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Weeks after his appointment, Lapeña launched a five-point program in a bid to clean the BOC and improve its performance. READ:  New Customs chief bringing own team The BOC commissioner said that he would eliminate the \"tara\" system, increase revenue collections, strengthen the government's anti-smuggling efforts and improve the incentives and reward systems for employees. Topping the priority list of Lapeña is ridding the agency perennially rated as one of the most corrupt government agencies of illicit practices and graft. He said that he would do this by imposing a \"no tara, no gift and no take\" policy at the Bureau. A \"one-strike\" policy is also in effect, according to Lapeña, and this could be seen by the firing of district collectors at the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port. He added that there were also recommendations to remove other personnel from these two offices. Aside from these initiatives, Lapeña is also instituting lifestyle checks on BOC officials and employees. READ:  Broker names 8 officials in Customs payoffs",

In a statement released Thursday, Movement Against Tyranny is hoping that the healing mass and walk along EDSA on November 5 would contribute to the people’s growing clamor to end EJKs and what it said as the increasing tyranny of President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. The group said the call of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines is “most urgent” given the continuing EJKs, “all-out war” against the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army and “war versus terrorism” especially in Mindanao.

It added: “It is time for him to reconfigure his brutal strategies into more humane, just and progressive solutions that address the social, economic and even cultural roots of the problems.” Movement Against Tyranny was launched last August by several groups and personalities critical of the actions and policies of the Duterte administration. On Tuesday, De La Salle Philippines President Br. Armin Luistro urged the school communities to “participate actively” in the activities on Sunday. “As one Lasallian community, we act in solidarity with other Filipinos in fight for dignity of human life and democracy,” Luistro, a former education chief, said. The “Lord Heal Our Land Sunday” event will commence a month-long period of church activities for the continued healing of the nation.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Japan has proposed measures for its cooperation with the Philippines against illegal drugs over the next five years, which will start in 2018. The scope of the Japan-Philippines action plan includes relapse prevention among illegal drug users, prevention of using illegal drugs and poverty alleviation. The mid-and-long term action plan came out after President Rodrigo Duterte's visit in Japan and his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. To prevent the use of illegal drugs, Japan proposed to increase awareness and promote drug abuse prevention education for juveniles, households, schools and local communities. \"For this purpose, Japan will offer cooperation such as introduction of useful examples, human resource development, provision of materials and benchmarking of best practices in drug abuse prevention and eradication in select local government units in Japan,\" the action plan read. The Japanese government would also provide vocational training and educational opportunities for illegal drug users in areas with high poverty incidence and drug prevalence. \"In view of interrelation between poverty and the use of illegal drugs, Japan will offer cooperation for the Philippine government to break the connection between illegal drugs use and poverty by providing educational opportunities and vocational training and skills improvement activities after the implementation of needs survey,\" the action plan said. For the prevention of relapse among illegal drug users, Japan vowed to provide appropriate treatment and rehabilitation protocols based on coordination between rehabilitation centers and community-based treatment facilities. \"Based on the outcome of the support for rehabilitation centers, Japan will support the Philippine government’s effort to extend those measures in priority areas in the Philippines, by providing necessary assistance including development of policies, facilities and human resources,\" the action plan read. Japan will also share its experience in developing a national center for treatment in support to the Philippine government's effort to strengthen community support mechanisms. In this regard, the Japanese government will provide training to encourage interaction of concerned people. Japan has also offered to review the current classification of illegal drug users who are subject to corrective actions under a court order. The classifications would include those who should receive corrective treatment in rehabilitation centers or those who should receive voluntary therapy in community-based centers. Last April, the Japanese government donated an estimated 1.85 billion yen or P826 million to the Department of Health for the upgrading of rehabilitation centers and enhancement of treatment protocols for drug dependents. The DOH signed the agreement with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency as part of the Consolidated Rehabilitation on Illegal Drug Users program.

According to the annual report of the World Economic Forum released November 2, the country dipped to 10th place this year from seventh place last year. It got a score of 0.790. The Philippines also ceded its position as the highest performer in the East Asia and the Pacific region to New Zealand, which scored 0.791. “A worsening performance on the wage equality for similar work indicator, dropping from 7th to 21st, partly accounts for this fall.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — There is no evidence that President Rodrigo Duterte is behind the drug-related killings allegedly attending the government's ferocious campaign to eradicate illegal drugs, his recently appointed spokesperson claimed. Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that as a lawyer he could say that there was no evidence to point to the complicity of Duterte in the mounting number of supposed drug-related killings and human rights abuses in the conduct of the administration's drug war. He added that there was also no proof that the government and its security services had been remiss in their duty to investigate and prosecute the people behind drug-related deaths which human rights groups claimed had already reached at least 12,000, a charge that authorities denied. \"The perception is he's behind the killings. I'm here to tell them as a lawyer that there's no evidence that he ordered the killing, and there's no evidence that we’re in any way in breach of our obligation to investigate and to prosecute,\" Roque said in an interview on ANC. READ:  Roque: Police cannot have own definition of extrajudicial killings He said that he could not imagine a lawyer who had experienced being a prosecutor for 10 years such as Duterte who would openly admit that he would violate the law. Roque also doused issues that his image as a human rights lawyer would pose a conflict of interest in his new position as the new presidential spokesman, the person primarily responsible to explain and clarify the pronouncements of the chief executive. \"I cannot imagine, I cannot fathom outside of the president's theatrics I cannot fathom a prosecutor who will openly admit that he wants to violate the law,\" he stated during the interview. He said that he would not have accepted the position if Duterte did not clarify that he was against illegal killings of suspects especially teenagers. He added that Duterte's denunciation of the killings of teenagers and other innocent people would show that the chief executive was \"in compliance\" with the country's obligations on human rights. \"I probably would not have accepted this post had not the president clarified his position immediately after Kian's killing. But with the pronouncement of the president, he is completely in compliance with our state obligations on human rights, to protect and promote the right to life,\" Roque said.

He also reiterated that his position against the reimposition of the death penalty and the lowering of the criminal age of responsibility remained even if the chief executive and his allies in Congress were publicly pushing for these initiatives. Despite his opposition to some programs, his job as the president's spokesperson was to \"mouth\" the president's positions. \"I will be [the] spokesperson, so I will have to mouth the President’s positions on these issues.

No,\" Roque emphasized, adding that his voting record against these proposed measures would speak for itself. READ: Palace can get 'explosive,' Roque warns. Should we be worried?

In a 74-page decision promulgated on Oct. 20, the Sandiganbayan’s Third Division said Ramon Talaga Jr. was found guilty of graft for the anomalous award of a computerization project to an unqualified service provider. Ofelia Garcia, former city government planning and development officer and technical evaluation committee chairperson, as well as budget officer Ester Mabita and assistant treasurer Mercedita Capulong, both bids and awards committee members, were meted the same prison term. The anti-graft court also ordered the former officials’ perpetual disqualification from holding public office. Former city treasurer’s office employee Roderick Abella and private individuals Ma. Prances Pelobello, Dennis Peter Lopinac and Matias Soriano were acquitted for lack of evidence. Filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2010, the case stemmed from the award of a P36-million contract to Amellar Solutions in 2002 for the computerization of the city government’s revenue generation system. The ombudsman said Talaga conspired with his co-accused and resorted to “selective or limited source procurement” instead of holding a public bidding in violation of the Government Procurement Reform Act. Graft probers said the former officials “deliberately and unilaterally” changed the terms of reference of the project to qualify the software used by Amellar, giving the service provider unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. In a decision promulgated on Oct. 6, the Sandiganbayan’s Fourth Division acquitted Talaga in connection with the award of a bingo franchise to Jose Sy Bang Sr. in 2000. The court said the prosecution failed to prove that the grant of the franchise was in exchange for the businessman’s support for Talaga during a recall election.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Former Igbaras, Iloilo mayor Jaime Esmeralda has been cleared of graft for allegedly failing to implement the rehabilitation of two roads in the town in 2004. In a recent decision, the Sandiganbayan’s Third Division said the prosecution failed to support allegations of conspiracy between Esmeralda and his co-accused. Also acquitted were former municipal treasurer Cynthia Cabañero, Esmeralda’s secretary Pio Elumba as well as private individuals Edwin Romualdo of E.S. Romualdo Construction and Arthur Go of Supply and South Pacific Builders Center Inc. In a complaint filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2008, the former officials were accused of not implementing the project despite the local government’s receipt of P1 million in financial assistance from the office of Sen. Franklin Drilon. The ombudsman said the accused gave unwarranted benefits to Romualdo and Go for payments amounting to P581,986 and P314,295, respectively, despite the non-implementation of the projects. However, in its ruling, the Sandiganbayan sided with Romualdo and Go’s defense that their only obligation under the contract was to supply the construction materials and heavy equipment. The Sandiganbayan gave weight to a Commission on Audit report which states that the construction materials and equipment were delivered on time. Records also showed that Romualdo and Go were awarded the contracts through public bidding. The court agreed with Esmeralda’s defense that ”the responsibility of implementing the infrastructure projects falls on the municipal engineer in accordance with the program of work.” During the trial, former municipal engineer Anastacio Escobodo admitted that it was his responsibility to implement the projects.              ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has cleared former Igbaras, Iloilo mayor Jaime Esmeralda of a criminal case over the alleged unimplemented road rehabilitation project in 2004. In its 23-page decision promulgated on October 6, the court's Third Division acquitted Esmeralda and his four co-accused of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. “From the foregoing, it can be inferred that the accused public officers did not cause any undue injury to any party including the government or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of [their] functions,” the Third Division's ruling read. “Neither did the accused private individuals unduly benefitted from the project,” it added. The court said the prosecution also failed to support with convincing evidence its allegation of conspiracy among the accused. The decision was penned by Associate Justice Bernelito Fernandez with the concurrence of division chairman and Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje-Tang and Associate Justice Sarah Jane Fernandez. Acquitted with Esmeralda were former municipal treasurer Cynthia Cabañero and former secretary to the mayor Pio Elumba, as well as private respondents Edwin Romualdo of E.S. Romualdo Construction and Arthur Go of Supply and South Pacific Builders Center Inc. Filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2008, the graft case stemmed from the respondents' alleged failure to carry out the rehabilitation of Kinagdan-Mulangan Road and Cale-Indaluyon Road despite the municipal government's receipt of P1-million financial assistance from the Office of Sen. Franklin Drilon who hails from Iloilo province. The ombudsman said there was “no showing of rehabilitation” of either of the two roads amid a Program of Work which specifically required the grading of the road surfaces, furnishing, placing and compacting of the aggregate base and laying out of culverts which would allow water to flow under the road. The ombudsman said the accused public officials gave unwarranted benefits to Romualdo and Go, for payments made despite the projects' non-implementation. In its ruling, however, the Third Division pointed out that as established during the trial, the two projects shall be implemented through “contract by administration,” in which, the concerned agency, in this case, the municipal government of Igbaras shall be the one to carry out the projects “through its own personnel.” The Third Division sided with the Romualdo and Go's defense that under their respective contracts with the municipal government, their only obligation was to supply the construction materials and heavy equipment, respectively, and not the actual implementation of the projects. The court gave weight on a Commission on Audit Technical Inspection Report, which states that the construction materials and equipment for the projects were timely delivered. Furthermore, the court said records show that the supply contracts were awarded to Romualdo and Go through competitive public biddings, thus their receipt of payments, amounting P581,986 and P314,295 respectively, upon the delivery of the required items, was justified. The court also agreed with Esmeralda's defense that “the responsibility of implementing the subject infrastructure projects falls on the municipal engineer” in accordance with the Program of Work. The court noted that even the prosecution's own witness, then municipal engineer Anastacio Escobido, admitted during cross-examination that the responsibility of implementing the two infrastructure projects lies with him and his staff. Following their acquittal, the court ordered the lifting of the hold departure order issued against all the accused. The court also ordered the release of the bail bond that they posted for their provisional liberty.  ",

    "title": "DOH chief backs passage of medical marijuana bill",
    "timestamp": "November 1, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — For Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, medical marijuana for compassionate use should be allowed in the country. According to Duque, he supports the use of cannabis for selected medical cases but security measures must be in place to prevent abuse. “Medical marijuana, as the bill is described, is for compassionate use. So, it should never be used by just anyone. There are people who qualify to benefit from medical marijuana,” he said, referring to House Bill No. 180 or the proposed Philippine Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act. Duque noted that in medical marijuana, “there must be very narrow applicability and must be strictly regulated.” The heath chief gave assurance that the Department of Health (DOH) is working closely with legislators on the technical aspects of the bill. “There are continuing consultations where we provide them our technical positions in order to ensure that the final version of the law will be clear and acceptable,” he added. Aside from this, the DOH is also making sure that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be fully capable of implementing the law if and when it gets approved. Last September, the House committee on health approved the bill which seeks the legalization and regulation of medical use of marijuana for some chronic conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or similar chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorders and epilepsy. Under Republic Act 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, marijuana or cannabis is classified as a dangerous drug. Government policymakers are not giving up on fulfilling President Duterte’s campaign promise of solving the illegal drug problem in the country. But instead of the original “three to six months” promised by the Chief Executive during the campaign period in last year’s national elections, the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) has set a more realistic target: a “drug-free” Philippines by the end of Duterte’s term in 2022. Based on the draft copy of the Philippine Anti-Illegal Drug Strategy (PADS) released by the DDB this week, being “drug-free” means that the country “has significantly reduced to manageable level the prevalence of drug use through expanded access to quality and evidence-based drug prevention and treatment interventions.” The document underscores five pillars of action to address the drug problem in the country, including drug supply reduction, drug demand reduction, civic awareness and response, alternative development and international cooperation. PADS, which is awaiting approval of the President, also highlights various priorities to achieve the objective of having a drug-free country by 2022. Priorities include institutionalization of community-based drug prevention and treatment and rehabilitation program, government subsidy for admission to rehabilitation center, random drug testing for students, review of existing policies and full implementation of existing laws. “Aside from supply reduction efforts, we would also like to focus on drug demand reduction programs or what we call the left-hand approach in the campaign against drugs,” DDB chairman Dionisio Santiago said. “These are preventive education, advocacy and civic awareness programs that aim to prevent people from abusing drugs and enlist their participation in the anti-drug campaign. Treatment and rehabilitation is also part of this strategy,” he added. Santiago announced last Monday the plan to launch a campaign that will address the drug problem from a different perspective. Called “Love Life. Fight Drugs,” the DDB chief said the campaign will focus on helping drug users free themselves from drug addiction. He said they hope the approach will reduce the killings related to the anti-illegal drug campaign. “We want to give opportunities to those who are being rehabilitated and in communities where there are drug addicts,” he said. In the same press conference, Santiago also said they would conduct next year a survey on drug prevalence, apparently in response to conflicting figures on the actual number of drug users in the country. “We want the figures that we release to be evidence-based and consistent,” he said in Filipino. Dionisio’s predecessor Benjamin Reyes was sacked by Duterte after he pegged the number of drug users to only 1.8 million, contrary to the President’s insistence that the drug problem is affecting as many as four million people. Reyes based his data on the results of a DDB survey conducted in 2015, while Duterte cited intelligence information from the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Santiago said the new survey may put an end to the confusion caused by the different data on drug prevalence. DDB deputy executive director for operations Earl Saavedra said they would want a credible survey firm like the Social Weather Stations or Pulse Asia to conduct the survey. He said, however, that they are still trying to figure out if the P15-million budget will be enough for project. “We want a survey instrumentality with the credibility and integrity to be able to release (believable) results to the public,” he added, noting that they would immediately start crafting the terms of reference by January. In addition to putting an end to conflicting data on drug prevalence, Saavedra said the survey would enable them to determine the impact of the fight against illegal drugs.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Can’t afford to buy a coffin for your dead? Caritas Manila, the social arm of the Archdiocese of Manila, is giving away preowned coffins to poor families who want to give their dead a decent burial. Caritas Manila’s executive director Fr. Anton Pascual said they have been providing recycled but sanitized coffins under its Damayan program. Pascual said these coffins were donated to them after the families cremated the bodies of their departed loved ones. Aside from 50 coffins made of wood or steel, Caritas also has new urns they could give to those in need. “We want to raise the Church’s level of intervention for the poor. The Good Samaritan program aims to intensify our charity work for our poor brothers and sisters,” he added. Families who want to avail themselves of burial assistance should get in touch with Caritas Manila. The applicants must undergo a screening process to make sure that they are indigents. “We also have partnerships with Catholic cemeteries such as the La Loma Cemetery. We have more or less P5,000 to P10,00 budget for burial assistance. This is part of the corporal works of mercy – to bury the dead,” Pascual said. While the Church is against gambling, Pascual said they don’t stop families from holding gambling such as “sakla” during the wake to help them cover burial expenses. Sakla is popular at wakes in the Philippines. Relatives of the deceased person need not break things to break the cycle of death, according to Fr. Eutiquio Belizar Jr. of the Diocese of Borongan in Eastern Samar.  Belizar, who chairs the Diocese of Borongan’s Commission on the Doctrine of the Faith, said, “There are superstitious beliefs in parts of Eastern Samar associated with death that may cause concern among the faithful.” The Church official said some residents usually break bottles or plates before the remains are brought out of the house to stop the cycle of death. Another belief is when a funeral procession passes by the deceased person’s house twice, it brings bad luck to the family. To correct these beliefs, Belizar urged parish priests, pastors and lay persons to catechize the faithful about Christian teachings on death and the afterlife. First aiders and ambulances of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) will be on standby to assist travelers during the obserance of All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day. PRC chairman and Sen.  Richard Gordon said they have mobilized volunteers to assist the public. More than 1,300 first aiders and foot patrollers were deployed in 170 cemeteries nationwide. The PRC set up 150 first aid stations, 40 of which are in Metro Manila. –  With Sheila Crisostomo, Rhodina Villanueva",

    "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 6:43pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office on Tuesday said the supposed unauthorized benefits identified by the Commission on Audit have been “part and parcel” of what employees and officials receive for over two decades. In the joint statement of Chairman Jose Jorge Cruz and General Manager Alexander Balutan, PCSO said the benefits were covered by various approvals from the previous presidents since the administration of Fidel Ramos. Although it defended the said benefits, PCSO explained that the gaming firm has immediately suspended and stopped the releases or grant of these questioned benefits to its officials and employees. “The PCSO management will continue to abide with this instruction and our employees fully support the same,” the firm said. It added: “On the other hand, we completely trust that this issue will be settled judiciously and fairly by observing the appeals mechanisms laid down under the COA Rules of Procedure.” READ: COA: PCSO employees, officials got P500M in unauthorized bonuses in 2016 This came as a response to COA’s 2016 Annual Financial Report on Government Owned and Controlled Corporations, which identified PCSO as the state firm with the highest unauthorized allowances and bonuses granted to its officials and employees amounting P518.314 million. Of the said amount, P503.667 million was for “payments of allowances, bonuses and other benefits that were not supported by sufficient legal basis,” while the remaining P14.647 million “pertains to payments of allowances that were in excess of prescribed rates.” The state auditors said the allowances and other perks were given despite the gaming firm's unsettled disallowances from the previous years totaling P1.213 billion, which also stemmed from infractions of government compensation rules. PCSO noted that the notices of disallowances issued by COA are still not final as many of these are pending appeals. Based on the COA report, the PCSO's 2016 pay package to its officials and employees includes the following: Christmas bonus (P151.174 million), educational assistance bonus (P123.817 million), grocery bonus (P71.08 million), weekly draw allowance (P60.267 million), hazard pay given to non-public health workers (P27.535 million), revenue performance incentive pay (P23.222 million) and some smaller amounts of allowances and anniversary bonus. Other state firms identified in the COA report to have granted perks without legal basis were Small Business Corporation (P46.448 million), National Electrification Administration (P23.683 million), Philippine Coconut Authority (P11.475 million), National Food Authority (P10.097 million), Apo Production Unit Inc. (P7.45 million), Human Settlements Development Corp. (P2.085 million) and Intercontinental Broadcasting Corp. or IBC-13 (P219,000). ",

    "content": "TOKYO — Japan will provide close to P60 billion worth of loans to the Philippines to support key infrastructure and development projects.\nThree projects will be funded by the loan, which had a total amount of 129.857 billion yen ($1.143 billion), statements released by the Japanese foreign ministry showed.\nThe assistance form part of the 1 trillion yen financial package for Philippine development projects pledged by Japan last year. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe committed to providing the loan during the first day of President Rodrigo Duterte’s visit here.\nTrade Secretary Ramon Lopez said the terms of the loans are friendly because of the robust ties between the Philippines and Japan.\n\"It’s really development assistance. It’s like giving a friend a very good deal,\" Lopez told reporters Wednesday here.\n\"It’s like a friend helping another friend,\" he added.\nAs much as 104.53 billion yen may be given to support the first phase of the Metro Manila Subway Project.\nThe project seeks to help address the traffic congestion in Metro Manila, ease atmospheric pollution and climate change and in turn promote investments in the Philippines.\nThe interest rate on the loan is 0.1 percent per annum while the repayment period is 28 years after a 12-year grace period.\nAbout 800 billion yen (P356 billion) is needed to complete the subway project. Incoming presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Japan might extend as much as $6 billion or about 600 billion yen worth of loan for the subway.\n\"There is a commitment from Prime Minister Abe himself about a $6 billion investment in a subway in the Philippines. This will be a tremendous help to the traffic problem in the country,\" Roque said.\n\"A subway is long delayed. I’m very glad to announce that in this trip, the $6 billion investment was formalized,\" he added.\"Part of the multibillion-peso loan will also fund the third phase of the arterial road bypass project, which costs about 9.399 billion yen.\"\nThe project seeks to help relieve traffic congestion and improve transportation capacity and efficiency in Plaridel City by building a bypass road along the Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway. The highway directly links Metro Manila with Central Luzon.\nThe interest rate for the road bypass project is 1.5 percent per annum while the repayment period is 20 years after the grace period of 10 years.\nJapan is also providing a 15.928 billion yen loan to fund the Cavite Industrial Area Flood Risk Management Project, which is expected to reduce flood damage in the province.\nForeign Affairs Secretary Alan Cayetano and Japan Foreign Minister Taro Kano exchanged notes on the project loan in the presence of Duterte and Abe last Monday.\nThe rate of interest on the loan is 0.3 percent per annum while the repayment period is 30 years after a 10-year grace period.\nRoque said Japan has also announced a currency swap that would allow the conversion of yen to Philippine peso.\n\"The peso and yen now convertible. That will be tremendous help to OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) because they lose money when they convert to dollar first before converting to peso,\" Roque said.\nRoque said Japan is also looking into investing $2 billion for a liquefied natural gas facility in the south.\nThe Japanese government also committed to providing the Philippines 40 patrol boats to strengthen its maritime defense capacity, he added.\nRoque said the assistance provided by Japan had nothing to do with maritime disputes in the region. There were speculations that Japan is assisting the Philippines to solicit support on its dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea\n\"I do not see why there is an ongoing race between China and Japan,\" Roque said.\n\"There's a policy of a veer towards Asia and I think the ever-improving ties between Asian countries, including both Asia and Japan, is a proof that we are not favoring one Asian country as against another,\" he added.\nRoque said the giving of assistance by Japan is part of \"soft diplomatic policy.\"\n\"As Filipinos, we welcome all countries to be our friends as well. But I'm not aware of any reciprocal obligation imposed on us. It was freely given to us, of course, it's an investment,\" Roque said.\n\"And I think as far as the Japanese government and Japanese businesses are concerned, they consider the Philippines as a viable destination for their investments,\" he added.\"Roque said the Philippines can give back to Japan by being a \"good friend.\"\nA total of 18 business deals were also signed during Duterte’s two-day visit here.

    "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 4:37pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Sen. Leila de Lima supports President Rodrigo Duterte’s call for the immediate passage of the Bangsamoro Basic Law amid threats of terrorism and extremism. “While not a perfect piece of document, the draft BBL represents a huge and monumental first step at addressing, in very concrete terms, the long-standing aspirations of our Muslim brothers and sisters. Their core aspiration is of course genuine autonomy and meaningful self-governance,” de Lima said in a statement Tuesday. The detained senator believes the draft BBL only needs some tweaking or fine-tuning of provisions to hurdle any constitutional challenge. For her, Filipinos cannot afford to miss this big shot at peace and stability in the region. “The urgency in actualizing the proposed changes in the governmental, political, fiscal and justice structures for the Bangsamoro people, to supplant the discarded, deficient ARMM set-up, is most felt now, hence, imperative, given the lingering and worsening threats of terrorism and extremism in the area,” de Lima said. She added: “Time is indeed running out. I don't see any other option, except chaos and more suffering for the people, Moros and Christians alike, in the region.” On Sunday, Duterte called on Congress to expedite the passage of the proposed BBL. “If we do not act on it expeditiously, I think that we are headed for trouble. We must continue to talk and I will urge Congress to fast-track it because they are getting impatient,” he warned during the media briefing before departing for Japan. Duterte said he had committed to both the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front to pass the BBL. “That is a commitment. Not even a promise but a commitment to the Moro people,” Duterte said. Duterte said that enacting the BBL would help boost peace in Mindanao alongside the government’s efforts to rehabilitate the war-torn city of Marawi. The draft BBL that the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) submitted to Duterte last July 17 reached Congress in August but its transmittal did not indicate it was urgent.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Palawan province in the Philippines could be within range of China's fighter jets and cruise missiles if deployed on their reclaimed outposts in the Spratly Islands, according to a US think tank. Washington-based AMTI Center for Strategic and International Studies made projections on the range of China's jets and missiles based on their equipment deployed on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands, which is claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam. The think tank noted that since 2014, Beijing has expanded its ability to monitor and project power throughout the contested waters through the construction of military assets on the Spratly and Paracel Islands. \"For the bases at Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs, fighter and missile ranges represent expected future deployments based on the hangars and shelters built to accommodate those assets,\" the think tank said. Fiery Cross Reef (Kagitingan), Mischief Reef (Panganiban) and Subi Reef (Zamora) are also being claimed by Manila. \"These include new radar and communications arrays, airstrips and hangars to accommodate combat aircraft, shelters likely meant to house missile platforms, and deployments of mobile surface-to-air and anti-ship cruise missile systems at Woody Island in the Paracels,\" the think tank said. The US think tank's map shows that the expected range of YJ-62 Chinese anti-ship cruise missiles can reach Palawan province and the northern part of Malaysia. On the other hand, the expected radii of China's J-10 fighter aircraft have a broader range than even reaches the Sulu Sea and a larger portion of Sabah, Malaysia.       The AMTI map depicted Beijing's ranges of known high-frequency radar installations as 300 kilometers while the smaller arrays were shown as 50 kilometers. Last June, the AMTI released satellite imagery showing that China is nearly complete in the construction of military facilities in the disputed waters despite the warming up of Manila's relations with Beijing. In July 2016, the Hague-based arbitral tribunal ruled that the three maritime features were originally high-tide features that do not legally generate their own continental shelf or exclusive economic zone. Beijing, however, refused to honor the arbitral decision and insisted that they have indisputable sovereignty over the region based on their nine-dash line claim in the South China Sea.

In a letter to Lasallian schools, De La Salle Philippines President Br. Armin Luistro urged the community to “participate actively” in the “Lord Heal Our Land Sunday” organized by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines. “As one Lasallian community, we act in solidarity with other Filipinos in fight for dignity of human life and democracy,” Luistro said. Luistro said Luzon-based schools would gather at the Chapel of the Divine Child in La Salle Green Hills at 2 p.m. After the orientation, they would walk to EDSA Shrine for the mass at 3 p.m. The former education chief encouraged the Visayas and Mindanao-based schools to hold similar activities and coordinate with local parishes.

Jose Mari Jimenez also urged the school communities to participate in the activities on November 5. “I wish for us to be involved in actions that raise awareness on the issue of human rights; that build solidarity with other like-minded groups; that engage us in formative actions to safeguard our democracy; and that bring relief or support those affected by acts of violence,” Jimenez said in a letter dated Oct. 25. The “Lord Heal Our Land Sunday” event will commence a month-long period of church activities for the continued healing of the nation. It will end on December 5, which marks the solemnity of Immaculate Conception.

    "content": "TOKYO – Japan yesterday promised to help the Philippines rebuild conflict-torn Marawi City as well as other infrastructure in a deepening of ties to counter China’s regional influence. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made the pledge in a joint statement with President Duterte following talks here. Duterte on Oct. 23 announced the end of five months of military operations in Marawi held by Islamic State-inspired terrorists in a conflict that destroyed much of the city’s center and displaced some 300,000 people. “The government of Japan recognizes that rehabilitation and reconstruction of the city of Marawi is extremely important,” the joint statement declared. “We will provide maximum support to the restoration and reconstruction of Marawi City and we will strengthen support of Mindanao toward the establishment of an autonomous government.” Japan also offered to help with other projects ranging from rail infrastructure to river defenses, including a possible 600-billion-yen loan to help fund development of a subway in Manila. The meeting was an opportunity for Abe to discuss security in Asia ahead of key regional meetings beginning with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in Vietnam in November. “I confirmed with President Duterte that we are both maritime nations sharing basic values and strategic interests,” Abe said. Duterte thanked Abe for supporting the Philippines’ efforts to address terrorism and violent extremism and his readiness to provide timely assistance to residents affected by the Marawi crisis.   “It is, therefore, fitting and proper, that after the liberation of Marawi City from the grip of Maute terrorists, my first official visit overseas takes place in Japan --- a true friend who has stood squarely behind the Philippines in my country’s onward advance (to) greater peace, progress and prosperity,” the President said.  The two countries, Abe  said, would address common issues including North Korea and “a free and open Indo-Pacific.” Japan is concerned about China’s growing power in the South China Sea and sees cooperation with the Philippines, which lies on the waterway’s eastern side, as key in helping prevent Beijing’s influence spreading into the western Pacific. Duterte, unlike his predecessor Benigno Aquino III, has been less critical of Beijing’s island building in the South China Sea. The Philippine leader is set to return to Manila today after an audience with the Japanese emperor. Abe and Duterte will travel to Vietnam for the two-day APEC meeting from Nov. 11, which US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend. Leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other countries in the region will meet again in the Philippines after the APEC gathering for the ASEAN and East Asia summits that will be chaired by Duterte.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) who defeated the Islamic State-inspired Maute terrorists in Marawi City after five months of fighting returned to Manila yesterday to be with their families for Christmas. More than 500 sailors, Marines and Seals of the Philippine Navy were welcomed as heroes by their spouses, children and parents. The soldiers were honored in recognition of their heroism followed by a motorcade from Manila’s Pier 13 to the Marine Base at Fort Bonifacio in Taguig. Members of the Fleet Marine contingent deployed in the Naval Forces Western Mindanao (NFWM) were also received by Philippine Navy Flag Officer In Command Vice Admiral Ronald Joseph Mercado during the ceremony. Mercado said the gallant men and women of the Philippine Navy who fought in Marawi would be given much-needed rest. “After this heroes’ welcome, we will be giving them a short break to be with their families,” he said.  “They are in high spirits, having successfully completed their mission in Marawi City,” Mercado added. He said the Philippine Navy alone suffered 36 casualties and over 300 injuries during the Marawi siege. The Philippine Navy spent nearly P500 million in ammunition and fuel for its naval and delivery operations during the five-month Marawi siege. Mercado said the battle for Marawi was costly. In Zamboanga City, the military gave a heroes’ welcome to troops who were among the composite team that killed Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute. The Fleet Marines and sailors were received by NFWM commander Rear Admiral Rene Medina and their families upon their arrival from Iligan City. Western Mindanao Command chief Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr. also received the contingents of the Army Scout Ranger who were deployed in Marawi. Galvez commended the soldiers for liberating Marawi from terrorists. Families of the soldiers and civilians showered the Marawi troopers with confetti and balloons. Thousands joined a symbolic prayer at the Marawi City hall to highlight its liberation from the Maute terrorists. The event was led by Mayor Majul Gandamra, officials of the Lanao del Sur provincial government, Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and representatives from the Wesmincom. The government can rebuild the devastated Marawi into a model city of Mindanao with proper planning, sufficient funding and political will, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito said yesterday. Ejercito, chairman of the Senate committee on urban planning and housing, said he and other members of the panel would visit Marawi along with experts to come up with a master plan to rebuild the city. Joining them will be Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who leads the inter-agency task force on the rehabilitation of Marawi, architect and urban planner Felino Palafox Jr. and other experts. – With Roel Pareño, John Unson, Paolo Romero ",

Yes, we continue to talk and I hope that Congress would expedite its approval,” the President said at a press conference at the Davao International Airport before leaving for a three-day visit to Japan the other night.

    "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — President Duterte vowed to watch his language when facing Japanese Emperor Akihito during a courtesy visit in Tokyo today.  Duterte said that aside from his dinner meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his three-day working visit to Japan included a meeting with the emperor. In a pre-departure press conference at the Davao airport on Sunday night, Duterte said he has to temper his language during his visit, when delivering the Filipinos’ warm greetings for Japan. The President cited the close ties between the Philippines and Japan, attributing it partly to the respect the two nations have for each others’ leaders. Duterte said it is important for him to visit the emperor this time, as he was not able to do so the last time he was in Tokyo. He said the death of the emperor’s uncle was one of the reasons his visit was called off. The emperor is expected to relinquish his throne next year.  “It’s kind of a homage to see the emperor before he abdicates,” Duterte said. He is the first head of state to visit Japan following Abe’s reelection last week.  This would be Duterte’s second visit to Tokyo and his third meeting with Abe, who reciprocated the gesture with a trip to Manila and Davao City in January. The President and his party, which included 17military battalion commanders and their staff who defended Marawi City, are expected to return home tonight. The officers joined the President on an Airbus 320 chartered flight that took off from Davao City on Sunday night, Philippine Army chief Maj. Gen. Rolando Joselito Bautista said. The trip to Japan was sort of a reward to the officers for defending Marawi. Another trip, this time to Hong Kong, is being arranged for female officers who took part in the operations against Maute terrorists. Duterte promised an all-expense-paid trip to Hong Kong for the female soldiers who helped defeat the Mautes.

    "content": "TOKYO – The Philippines and Japan yesterday condemned the missile tests by North Korea and called for the resumption of talks to defuse the tension in the Korean Peninsula.  President Duterte said North Korea’s missile tests pose a threat to regional stability and should be resolved peacefully.  “We need to address many issues confronting the region and threats to the stability and security (in the) Asia-Pacific. Foremost among our shared concern are developments in the Korean peninsula and the continuing missile launch tests of North Korea,” Duterte said after his meeting with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe here.  “We condemn these tests and call on all concerned stakeholders to return to the negotiating table to peacefully resolve the situation,” he added.  North Korea has continued to beef up its nuclear program despite economic sanctions by the United Nations and widespread condemnation by the international community.  The rogue state previously threatened to launch ballistic missiles toward Guam, where a US military base is located, prompting US President Donald Trump to declare that he would meet any threat to his country with “fire and fury.”  Japan, South Korea and East Asian countries that also host US military installations are also bracing for possible missile attacks. Last April, member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said they are concerned over the issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula as these seriously threaten peace, security and stability in the region and the world. Before leaving for Japan, Duterte said a nuclear war was “unacceptable” as he cited the need for stakeholders to hold talks with Kim. “All leaders agree that he is a dangerous man. You must remember that he is a leader of his people… Whatever he proclaims himself to be, somebody has to talk to him,” he added.   Duterte said it would be “good” if the US, Japan and South Korea talk with North Korea to convince the totalitarian state to stop the threats. But he believes that only China can calm down the North Korean leader.  Duterte said Kim should also be given an assurance that there is  no plan to oust him. Last week, Kim warned that the US should take seriously his threats of nuclear testing and weapon development. – With Edith Regalado ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — University of Santo Tomas law dean Nilo Divina yesterday denied any criminal liability in the fatal hazing of law freshman Horacio “Atio” Castillo III by members of the Aegis Juris fraternity. Divina, who says he is on leave as a member of Aegis Juris, appeared before the Department of Justice (DOJ) and sought the dismissal of murder, hazing and obstruction of justice charges filed against him by Castillo’s parents. In a 30-page counter-affidavit, the law dean argued that he cannot be held liable as an accomplice of the fraternity members involved in the fatal hazing simply because he was not aware of it and only learned of Castillo’s death after the initiation rites. “Contrary to the complainants’ claim, through their counsel, I could not have had any knowledge that hazing is being practiced or that Atio was being hazed,” he stressed. Divina lamented that the complaint failed to cite an overt act he committed to make him liable for Castillo’s death, pointing out that the allegations against him were based on “wild speculations, conjectures and surmises” and mere association with the fraternity.  “My mere continued membership in the fraternity (albeit on an inactive status) cannot be basis of their claim of my alleged criminal knowledge, acquiescence or approval of the hazing,” read his answer. Divina reiterated that he has taken a leave from the fraternity since he became dean of the law school and that the university administration implements a total ban on hazing rites. He also denied the allegation that he was part of the cover-up of Castillo’s death by their fraternity based on his statement before the Senate inquiry that he issued a blanket suspension “to allow those responsible to escape undetected... and at the very least to avoid being directly questioned by the MPD (Manila Police District).” The law dean argued that such action cannot be considered as a crime under the Anti-Hazing Law, stressing that the preventive suspension of the fraternity members was meant to “protect the student body and to alleviate their fears brought about by news reports concerning Atio’s death with the possible complicity of some members of Aegis Juris.” Divina said he was not involved in the cover-up since he even reported the matter to the Father Regent who represents the university administration in the law school immediately upon learning about the incident.",

    "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — He’s not just a mouthpiece but also a staunch defender of his boss, so don’t make the mistake of crossing paths with newly appointed presidential spokesman Harry Roque. “If, in the past, you were able to throw stones without anyone hitting back, be warned that if you throw stones, I won’t just throw stones but hollow blocks,” Roque said in a video interview with Communications Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson before they joined Duterte on a working visit to Japan the other night. “Stop throwing stones. If you want, just help the country with the many problems it is facing. Just wait for the adobe and hollow blocks that I will throw at you,” Roque warned. He clarified though that he also believes in “allowing the marketplace of ideas to flourish.” The President officially announced the appointment of Roque, former Kabayan party-list representative, as presidential spokesman replacing Ernesto Abella, who has reportedly been offered positions in other offices, including ambassador to either Australia or Germany. Roque said he looks forward to being able to communicate the government’s messages to the Filipino people in his new role. He noted that he has not had a negative experience with the press in the past and hopes to have a good working relationship with the media and the Malacañang Press Corps. Although his first Cabinet meeting would be on Nov. 6, Roque already got to work as presidential spokesman when he acted as moderator of the President’s pre-departure press briefing Sunday night. Duterte is confident that Roque would live up to expectations. “It’s in the messaging, actually. We cannot speak the same words altogether but how he would convey that message from me would be most important,” the President said. He refused to detail why he had to replace Abella and appoint Roque as presidential spokesman, except to say that “the reason is my personal decision, I am not about to explain why I did it.” Senators wished Roque good luck and advised him to make sure he clarifies the President’s messages. “I hope he (Roque) does a good job. I know he’s got a difficult job but just a reminder: he should balance things. He shouldn’t quarrel with everyone. Let’s not add to negativity. We should help clarify matters,” said Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito. “The President has a very colorful personality but that’s the way he is – no nonsense,” he added, noting that the President’s communications team should be at the forefront in mending strained relationships, especially with communities like the European Union. Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III said each presidential spokesperson has his or her own style of speaking for the president, as detained Sen. Leila de Lima lamented that Abella’s departure could mean the “further decline of the level of discourse and language we could expect from now on from the President and his men.” Roque said he will have to wrap up his affairs in Congress and formally inform Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez about his new post. He plans to bring with him his staff of six to Malacañang and introduce changes in the setup in the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson. “But those things have to wait till after Christmas,” Roque said, adding that he still has to look into his new post and the policies and management of the office. He recalled that Special Assistant to the President Christopher Go first called on him about the position last Oct. 14 while he was on vacation in Japan. They met in a restaurant near Malacañang two days after. Roque met with the President on Oct. 27 during a dinner at the Marina Tuna Seafood Restaurant in Davao City where they discussed the offer for him to become presidential spokesman. Prior to this appointment, Roque also served as head of the Center for International Law, the Philippine-based human rights advocacy group whose lawyers represented families of the victims of the Ampatuan massacre and the kin of transgender Jennifer Laude.",

    "content": "TOKYO – At least 25 business deals representing roughly $6 billion in new investments have been signed by Philippine and Japanese firms in a development that officials said affirmed investor confidence in the Philippines. President Duterte witnessed the signing yesterday of the agreements, which are expected to release Japanese investments in manufacturing, shipbuilding, iron and steel, agribusiness, power, renewable energy, transportation, infrastructure, mineral processing, retailing, information and communication technology, and business process management. “President Duterte met several Japanese companies and witnessed several B-B MOUs (business-to-business memoranda of understanding) and letters of intent on investment plans, joint ventures and expansion of operations in the Philippines,” Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said in a statement. “Total new investments (are expected to reach) $6 billion,” he added. A list of companies that signed the agreement was not available as of yesterday but incoming presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the deals would be undertaken by “big multinational” and “Filipino giant” corporations. “If I’m not mistaken, there were at least 25 agreements that were witnessed by the President today (Oct. 30),” Roque said in a chance interview here. “I think it’s because there is, number one, commercial predictability, number two, there is peace and order in the Philippines and there is conducive business environment where businesses are safe from unjust taking,” he added. Roque said the signing of business deals also highlighted the “very strong” relations between the Philippines and Japan. “It also proves that Japan continues to be one of our most active trading partners,” the incoming presidential spokesman said. Among the companies that signed business deals are the Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp. and Metro Pacific Investments, which forged agreements with Hitachi and Itochu. The group of businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan was also scheduled to meet with Japanese firms NTT, Rakuten, Itochu, Mitsui, Marubeni, Densan and Hitachi. Lopez said he also met with his Japanese counterpart Hiroshige Seko to discuss ways to improve market access and lower tariff for Philippine agricultural products like banana, pineapple and mango. Asked about the Japanese trade minister’s reaction to his request to lower the tariff for Philippine agricultural exports, Lopez replied: “They took note of that and to be discussed in detail in the technical working groups under JPEPA (Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement).” JPEPA is the bilateral trade agreement between the Philippines and Japan. It was signed by former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and then Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi in Helsinki, Finland in September 2006. The agreement assures zero duties for more than 90 percent of Philippine exports to Japan and is expected to enhance the access of Filipino service workers to the Japanese market. It also requires the removal of tariffs by both Japan and the Philippines on almost all industrial goods within 10 years from the date of its implementation. The two trade chiefs also tackled the Industrial Cooperation Dialogue and ways to improve the supply chain for Japanese companies to benefit Philippine small and medium enterprises.",

Trump earlier declared a national emergency over opioid addiction in the US, particularly fentanyl abuse, saying the issue has become a “national shame.” Reacting to Trump’s move, Duterte said he had recognized the problem early on as he again taunted former US president Barack Obama for his critical stand on Duterte’s vicious war on drugs. “I would deal with President Trump in the most righteous way, welcome him as an important leader, as a matter of fact, the important leader on this side of the planet,” the President said. “And, I would have to also listen to him what he has to say.” But before the Manila summit, Duterte and Trump are also expected to meet in Da Nang, Vietnam on Nov. 8-10 at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Trump will travel to Asia on Nov. 3-14 amid rising tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. He will be in Manila on the last leg of his trip, which includes visits to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam, to attend the ASEAN leaders’ summit and related meetings. Trump will meet with Duterte but will skip the larger meeting in Manila with heads of states and governments from China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand. Duterte said he was glad Trump had also acknowledged the seriousness of the drug problem. “For example, like declaring a national emergency regarding the drug issue. But these are on the level of a societal problem. It’s not a problem of law and order. There are no warlords there,” the President further said. But Duterte explained the drug problem in the US is not the same as that of the Philippines. “Maybe, illegal ha – illegal handguns, very few, far and in between, not the kind of the drug problem that we have here. That including mayors and barangay captains are affected heavily,” Duterte added. The Philippine leader is known for his often profanity-laden tirades against the US, chiding Washington for treating the Philippines “like a dog,” despite the two nations’ longstanding relationship. The Philippines’ leader announced his “separation” from the US during a visit to Beijing a year ago, declaring he had realigned with China as the two agreed to resolve their South China Sea dispute through talks. Duterte was infuriated by expressions of concern by members of former president Obama’s administration about extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. But Trump, in a phone call to Duterte in May, praised the Philippine leader for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem” despite human rights groups’ condemnation of Duterte’s drug crackdown, in which thousands of people have been killed. Human rights, rule of law and due process are among “important developments” the two leaders would likely discuss during their bilateral talks, US Ambassador Sung Kim told foreign correspondents last week. Duterte is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines, which his government denies. He defended his 16-month-old campaign last week, telling Southeast Asian lawyers at a gathering in Manila that he had been “demonized” and again denied allegations of state-sponsored killings of drug dealers and users. Duterte, speaking in Davao City on Sunday night, said the situation in the Korean Peninsula would be the main agenda item in his talks with Trump. “We are worried. If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong,” he said. “A nuclear war is totally unacceptable to everybody.” Duterte said it would be good if the United States, Japan and South Korea would sit down and talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and “tell him that nobody’s threatening him, that there would be no war and that if you can just tone down or stand down, stop the threats, and that would be the same for America.” Duterte previously described Kim as a “fool” and “son of a b***h” for “playing with dangerous toys.”",

    "title": "DILG installs new mayor of Iloilo City",
    "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "ILOILO CITY, Philippines — Officials of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Region 6 wasted no time in serving the dismissal order yesterday against Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog. DILG lawyers arrived at 12:30 p.m. at Mabilog’s office at the Iloilo City Hall to serve the order. Lawyers Anthony Nuyda, DILG Region 6 director, and Cedrick Jaranilla, DILG-6 legal officer, together with Iloilo City lawyer Ferdinand Panes arrived at Mabilog’s office, which was already cleaned and the mayor’s personal items removed. Vice Mayor Jose Espinosa III was sworn in as acting mayor to serve the rest of the term of Mabilog until the midterm elections in 2019. As earlier assured by Mabilog’s camp, the service of the order was done without fuss or resistance. Jaranilla read the dispositive portion of the order dismissing Mabilog from holding public office. “Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog is found guilty of serious dishonesty relative to his unlawful acquisition of wealth. Accordingly, he is meted penalty of dismissal from the service with cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar from taking civil service examinations,” the order stated. “In the event that the penalty of dismissal can no longer be enforced against respondent, the penalty shall be converted into fine in the amount equivalent to his salary for one year, payable to the Office of the Ombudsman, or may be deductible from his retirement benefits, accrued leave credits or any receivable from his respective office. It shall be understood that the accessory penalties attached to the principal penalty of dismissal shall continue to be imposed.” “Jed Patrick Mabilog is hereby directed to cease and desist from exercising the powers, functions and privileges of the office of the City Mayor of Iloilo or from any other government position he may now or afterwards hold effective immediately upon receipt hereof,” according to Jaranilla, who read the order. “Furthermore, Mayor Mabilog is hereby directed to turn over all properties and documents to the office of and functions to Vice Mayor Jose Espinosa III, who shall assume office as local chief executive of Iloilo City who shall serve the unexpired portion of his term.” Lawyer Joenar Pueblo, Mabilog’s counsel, received the dismissal order. “As counsel, I will receive this but then again, as stated, this should be personally received by Mayor Jed, no citizen Jed Patrick Mabilog,” he pointed out. But the DILG-6 officials stated that the order is executory pending appeal. As Espinosa was present, he immediately took office. Espinosa said that he would only aim for good governance for the people of Iloilo City. He also vowed to continue the good things Mabilog has started. The newly designated mayor said that he would work to make Iloilo City a safer place where people could sleep peacefully and go out at night without any fear. Meanwhile, Councilor Eduardo Peñaredondo, Mabilog’s ally, said that they sympathize with the ousted mayor. Last Sunday, Pueblo said they will file a petition for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) following reports that the DILG will immediately implement the dismissal order. Pueblo will file this week a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, with the prayer for issuance of TRO before the Court of Appeals. “But if they can’t be stopped, we couldn’t do anything about. What we are asking is for them to wait until we could file a petition for a TRO,” he said. If the DILG would insist, Pueblo added they would just contest the dismissal order before the Court of Appeals, or even the Supreme Court. Last week, the Office of the Ombudsman confirmed Mabilog’s dismissal after he was found guilty of serious dishonesty for his alleged questionable wealth. President Duterte has repeatedly accused Mabilog of being a narco-politician.",

    "title": "Rody: Sue me over Marawi devastation",
    "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — If anyone is to be sued for the devastation of Marawi City during the five-month conflict between government forces and the Islamic State-linked Maute group, it should be President Duterte and no one else, according to the Chief Executive himself. “I hold myself solely responsible for what happened, including... the incidents there, the events that transpired. Sabi ko (I said), ‘I take full responsibility for all,’” Duterte said. In going after the Maute terrorists, the President also declared martial law in Mindanao, which is expected to be lifted by the end of the year.  He earlier declared the liberation of Marawi City from terrorists after the deaths of their leaders Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute.  A group of residents and concerned citizens is reportedly planning to file charges against the government for the assault on Marawi, which resulted in the displacement of more than 200,000 people and the deaths of more than 1,000, at least 169 of whom were government forces.  “Let me answer you here and now, that I declared martial law to answer the challenges of the moment and I take full legal, criminal and civil liability. Ako ’yun (It was me),” Duterte said during a press conference at the Davao International Airport here before he left for a three-day working visit to Tokyo the other night.  The President said it is within the rights of individuals, groups or organizations to file such charges even before the International Criminal Court.  “Yes. It’s well within their rights to do that. I agree… that if you have a gripe, and you think that justice should be done, and if they think that the Philippine courts would be prejudiced or biased, they can always go to the International Criminal Court,” he said. The Chief Executive likewise said he is amenable to the conduct of a deeper investigation on how the Maute group was able to get so much materiel to fight the government in Marawi City. Duterte said that as far as his office is concerned, it would be the executive department and the Armed Forces and the police that should study carefully how the fighting evolved and how to fight a new war. Duterte said government forces need more training in urban warfare. “That’s why… it is a universal fact that in the Middle East, it took them one year, two years to do it. It’s because there is always a high-rise building, where you can position yourself comfortably while waiting for the kill, and I said, in penetrating a lot of almost indestructible cover,” he said. Meanwhile, Duterte ordered government forces to finish off the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf and Maute groups by December, Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., chief of the Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom), said. The Westmincom, according to Galvez, would redeploy the forces in Maguindanao, Basilan and Sulu to sustain its operations against the remaining terrorist cells. He said there are two prominent terrorists groups left in Maguindanao and their movements were being tracked in the areas of Piagapo and Butig towns. – With Roel Pareño",

    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 9:43pm",
    "content": "TOKYO – The Philippines and Japan are entering a “golden age” of strategic partnership, President Duterte said yesterday, as he thanked the Japanese government for its readiness to support his programs and the rehabilitation of battle-torn Marawi City. “Our commitment and resolve show the desire to further expand cooperative ties. I dare say that, considering what we have accomplished and achieved, the Philippines and Japan are building a golden age (for) our strategic partnership,” Duterte said after his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “It’s a commitment founded on the democratic values we hold dear. It’s a resolve that has withstood the test of time. Working together, we should have much to show and to be proud of in the years to come,” he added. Duterte is here for a two-day official visit that seeks to boost the ties between the Philippines and Japan. His visit came days after Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party won an overwhelming victory in recent snap elections. It was his second visit to Japan, which occupied the Philippines for three years during World War. Duterte first visited the East Asian country last year.  “As strategic partners, cooperation between the Philippines and Japan is expansive and multi-dimensional. Both sides recognize today that there is still ample room for even more significant growth in all areas of mutual concern,” Duterte said. Abe said it was a great honor to welcome Duterte, whom he described as his “dear and cherished friend.”   He also vowed to provide “maximum support” to the Duterte administration’s efforts to rebuild Marawi City, which was ravaged by five-month-long clashes between government forces and Islamist militants. “We will provide maximum support to the restoration and reconstruction of Marawi City and we will strengthen support of Mindanao toward the establishment of an autonomous government,” Abe said.  “Regarding the declaration of liberation of Marawi in Mindanao, I’d like to express my heartfelt respect for the leadership exerted by His Excellency President Duterte going forward in his efforts to fight terrorism and also for the stability in Mindanao and the development; and in his attempts to ensure this, we would like to provide full support to President Duterte’s approaches,” he added. Duterte thanked Abe for supporting the Philippines’ efforts to address terrorism and violent extremism and his readiness to provide timely assistance to residents affected by the Marawi crisis. “It is, therefore, fitting and proper that after the liberation of Marawi City from the grip of Maute terrorists, my first official visit overseas takes place in Japan --- a true friend who has stood squarely behind the Philippines in my country’s onward advance (to) greater peace, progress and prosperity,” the President said. Duterte said he was also honored to be the first Southeast Asian head of state and government to visit Japan since Abe’s electoral victory. Japan promised to swiftly provide equipment for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Marawi and surrounding areas. The Japanese government will also consider extending further assistance including possible support for road construction and improvement. Duterte also welcomed Japan’s willingness to provide a 1 trillion yen or about P430 billion package for the Philippines’ development projects. “I am pleased with Japan’s reiteration that it is fully committed to – as he described it – “give flesh” to the 1 trillion yen or close to nine billion dollars pledge (of) assistance to the Philippines,” the President said. “This covers huge impact and high value infrastructure projects that my country needs to sustain and spur our economic growth. There will be some of the most ambitious and groundbreaking projects, including the Metro Manila Subway project, and major developments in the regions and provinces,” he added. Abe vowed to fast-track the building of a subway in Metro Manila and the implementation of projects for the North South Commuter Rail. He said his government would implement medium to long term action plans related to illegal drugs and measures for maritime safety that would include efforts against terrorism. “We will proceed with cooperation to enhance coastal surveillance capacity building. And we will further provide support to strengthen safety in Sulu and Celebes Seas and other parts of the region,” the Japanese leader said. Abe said the mobile cooperation team launched this month by the Coast Guard would be conducting training exercises in Manila. “The Coast Guards of Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia will be participating toward the realization of an Indo-Pacific which is a free and open. We hope that this will be a model case for cooperation,” he added. The two leaders also promised to further promote bilateral cooperation in energy, employment creation, information and communication technology, environment, agriculture and disaster reduction. “I conformed with President Duterte that we are both maritime nations sharing basic values and strategic interests. And as such, Japan and the Philippines will cooperate to address common issues such as North Korea nuclear and missile issue and the only resolution of the abduction issue and realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific and also counter measures against terrorism and illegal drugs,” Abe said. “I would like to work hand in hand with my close friend President Duterte to further deepen the bonds of friendship between our two countries and we’ll cooperate towards peace and prosperity of the region and international community,” he added.",

    "title": "Sereno lawyers say impeachment 'one-sided' if barred from cross-examining witnesses",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 7:50pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The lawyers of Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno on Monday warned that the impeachment proceedings against her would turn into a \"one-sided\" affair if their camp would be barred from cross-examining witnesses who would testify against her. Sereno's lawyers also urged the public to remain vigilant especially against moves that would deprive the chief magistrate of her constitutional right to due process in the impeachment case being heard by the House Committee on Justice. \"What will happen is that the determination of probable cause will be a one-sided affair and we think that it should not be the picture seen both by the public and the members of the committee,\" Josa Deinla, Sereno's lawyer and spokesperson, said in a radio interview. Sereno's camp was reacting to the statement of House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez that she would be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses only if she would show up at the committee hearing. Alvarez claimed that Sereno's failure to appear would be tantamount to the waiving of this right, a proposition that the chief magistrate's lawyers disagreed with. According to Deinla, their legal team thinks that Sereno, just like any other ordinary respondent or accused, has the right to cross-examine the witnesses who would speak against her through her lawyers. They said this was part of the \"due process of law\" enshrined and protected by the Constitution. \"Under our Constitution, since she is the accused, Sereno has the right to be defended by her lawyers,\" Deinla pointed out. \"Only she has the right to decide whether or not to exercise this right since she is a respondent, who is similar to an accused, and not just a witness or resource person invited by Congress,\" she added. The chief magistrate's spokesperson said their legal team would insist on their motion to recognize her \"constitutionally guaranteed rights\" when the Justice Committee resumes its hearing on November 20. They also would like to know the position of the other members of the committee because so far it was only the speaker who expressed his opinion on the issue. Sereno's lawyers led by Alex Poblador sought confirmation from the justice panel in a motion filed on October 23 that persons testifying as witnesses or resource persons against the chief justice might be \"cross-examined by her counsel on her behalf.\" “The right to be heard and be defended by counsel in all stages of a criminal proceeding is a very basic right of an individual, which not even this Honorable Committee, indeed Congress, can take away from a respondent in an impeachment proceeding,” the lawyers said in the motion. They also inquired if they would be allowed to object to improper questions during the direct examination of the complainant's witnesses and be furnished with all documentary and testimonial evidence in support of the charges against Sereno. The House under Alvarez has been criticized in the past for allegedly allowing the \"slut-shaming\" of detained Sen. Leila De Lima after questions about her supposed love affair with her driver were asked during a committee hearing. Sereno is facing moves to impeach her from office following allegations by former Gloria Arroyo lawyer Lorenzo Gadon that she failed to declare income received from a case in which she represented the Philippine government. Gadon, a defeated senatorial candidate of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, also alleged that the chief magistrate had lived a lavish lifestyle. Political analyst Ramon Casiple recently revealed that Gadon was pursuing the case as revenge to what happened to Arroyo and former Chief Justice Renato Corona, an accusation that he denied.",

    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 7:29pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Arvin Balag, believed to be Aegis Juris Fraternity's president, insisted he could not be held liable for the death of neophyte Horacio \"Atio\" Castillo III due to the complainants' failure to prove that he participated in the brotherhood's initiation rites. In his counter-affidavit filed before state prosecutors Monday, Balag said allegations made against him are \"not equivalent to proof,\" adding that his \"presence nor participation\" in the fatal initiation rites of Aegis Juris Fraternity was not proven by complainants. Murder, anti-hazing, robbery and obstruction of justice raps were filed against Balag and several other members of Aegis Juris Fraternity for the death of Castillo. Two separate raps were filed by the Manila Police District and the Castillo's parents. Balag pointed out that the complainants \"presented no witnesses stating my actual direct participation to the supposed illegal hazing done to Atio as a neophyte of Aegis Juris Fraternity.\" \"It is self-serving and purely hold speculative accusation in the absence of specific allegation of facts in the complaint showing my participation in the commission of the subject offenses,\" he added. Balag also denied being part of the Facebook conversation that discussed how to handle the death of Castillo. \"I hereby categorically and specifically deny that I have any knowledge or that I am a party in the conversation mentioned in the 'screenshots of conversation' derived from Facebook,\" Balag said. After the denial, he then proceeded to argue that the screenshots could not be considered as admissible evidence as they were not \"properly authenticated.\" Balag also decried that his \"constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy of communication and correspondence\" was violated due to the screenshots. During the Senate's hearing on Castillo's case, MPD's  Supt. Joel Coronel showed two threads of Facebook conversations among the Aegis Juris Fraternity members and some alumni discussing how to proceed with the death of Castillo. He added that the screenshots were already being authenticated by the authorities. Coronel said the conversations prove that the members intended to evade prosecution. The fratman also cited the same defense used by his co-respondents John Paul Solano and Alexander Hipe in their earlier filed counter-affidavit. Balag insisted that the medico-legal report stated that Castillo died with \"grossly normal\" kidney, which meant that the injuries he might have sustained due to hazing did not kill him. \"Simply put, there is no finding in any manner whatsoever that [Castillo] suffered multiple organ failure which is the reported common cause of death from hazing. Thus, the most likely proximate cause of the death of [Castillo] is cardiac arrest because of HCM, and not due to hazing,\" his counter-affidavit reads. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, in a news conference last week, detailed the final grueling hours of Castillo in the hands of his would-be fraternity brothers. Citing the sworn affidavit of witness Mark Ventura, Aguirre said that Castillo was punched for about an hour until his arms were black and blue and swollen. It was also revealed that members of the fraternity took turns hitting Castillo with a paddle until he collapsed. Balag is currently detained at the Senate after Sen. Grace Poe moved to cite him in contempt for repeatedly refusing to answer her questions on whether he heads the fraternity.",

    "title": "‘Catch real drug lords, not fictitious ones,’ Duterte told",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 7:10pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Instead of targeting imaginary drug lords, President Rodrigo Duterte should investigate the drug smugglers supposedly living inside his household, Sen. Leila de Lima said on Monday. In a statement, De Lima said Duterte is not interested in catching real drug lords as he is “merely using his notorious drug war as a platform for vengeance against the political oppositions.” Duterte should investigate his son and son-in-law instead of going after fictitious drugs lords which include Sen. Franklin Drilon, former Interior and Local Government chief Mar Roxas and dismissed Iloilo Mayor Jed Mabilog, she said. “He should go after the real drug lords. In order to do this, Mr. Duterte does not even have to go that far. Apparently, the drug smugglers are living right inside his own household,” De Lima, who is detained for drug-related charges, said. Duterte’s son Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte and son-in-law Manases Carpio were both tagged by Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV as the individuals behind the alleged Davao Group. De Lima made the statement after Ricky Serenio, a self-confessed bagman of the so-called Berya drug cartel, claimed in an affidavit that Drilon and Roxas were protectors of slain suspected drug dealer Melvin Odicta Sr. Odicta reportedly controlled the narcotics trade in Iloilo City, according to Serenio in an affidavit he submitted to La Carlota City prosecutor’s office in Negros Occidental last October 18. READ: Drug suspect tags Drilon, Roxas as protectors In a statement Saturday, the Liberal Party decried anew the allegations linking the two stalwarts to the narcotics trade, saying the accusation was a ploy by the Duterte administration to hide its “own horror stories.” “The move to link several prominent Liberal Party members to illegal drugs is their attempt to cover their lack of governance, which requires hard work, facts, and truth,” the former ruling-party said in a statement. In a Facebook post, Roxas said he was shocked at the brazenness of his accuser to invent lies about him. “Sabi nga ng mga kids ngayon, petmalu ng imagination (As kids say nowadays, incredible imagination)!” Roxas, who was LP’s standard bearer in last year’s elections but lost to President Duterte, said. He added: “I don’t know nor have I any dealings with Serenio nor Odicta; as in zero.” READ: LP: Drilon-Roxas 'drug links' tactic of Duterte admin to conceal 'own horror stories', LP: Drug links aim to demonize party",

    "title": "HRW: Japan should call out Duterte over drug war killings, abuses",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 6:33pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Tokyo should publicly call on the Philippine government to end its \"murderous\" campaign to eradicate illegal drugs while President Rodrigo Duterte is embarking on a three-day state visit in Japan which started on Sunday, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog, said that Duterte's visit to Japan would provide Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his government a \"fresh opportunity\" to end their \"long silence\" on Manila's war on drugs which rights groups said has claimed at least 12,000 lives, a figure disputed by Filipino officials. Abe should also urge Duterte to take steps to hold those responsible for these deaths accountable, according to Phelim Kine, the deputy director of the Asia division of HRW. \"While the United States and the European Parliament have publicly criticized the extrajudicial killings of more than 12,000 suspected drug users and dealers since Duterte took office 15 months ago, the Japanese government has adopted a wholly uncritical business-as-usual posture with the Philippine government,\" Kine said in a statement over the weekend. This is not the first time that HRW has called on Tokyo to be more critical of the government's campaign against narcotics. In February, HRW also criticized Japan for its \"business as usual\" stance on the abuses committed in Duterte's drug war. HRW contrasted this with the strong stand of the United States and the European Union against drug-related killings and human rights abuses alleged to have been committed by police and hooded vigilantes. The group said then that providing prestige and development assistance to the Philippines without insisting on protections for human rights was not just \"wasted opportunity\" but also an \"encouragement\" to the Duterte government. Kine said that Abe should recognize the \"human rights calamity\" that the tough-talking Duterte had inflicted on the Philippines, adding that this should be meted with a coordinated response from partners of the Philippines such as Japan which value human rights. Abe could do this, Kine said, by denouncing the anti-drug campaign, by supporting a United Nations-led investigations into the killings and publicly supporting only voluntary, community-based drug treatment services that adhere to international standards and principles of human rights. Japan has missed in the past opportunities to call out the Philippines for massive human rights abuses and killings committed as it pursues its anti-drug campaign. Kine said that this was on display when Abe pledged a five-year, $800 million assistance to the Philippines to promote economic and infrastructure development during the premier's state visit from January 12 to 13. A month later, Japan's Vice Minister of Defense for International Affairs Ro Manabe endorsed the country's chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2017. \"Manabe offered this plum support without reference to the rampant extrajudicial executions,\" Kine said. The Japan International Cooperation Agency failed to ask the Philippine Department of Health for details on how it would spend $17 million in assistance for the upgrading of drug rehabilitation centers and enhancement of treatment protocols for drug dependents, according to Kine. Kine added that this could risk the money going to drug-rehabilitation approaches linked to \"serious human rights violations\" in other parts of Asia. Duterte's anti-drug campaign has faced stringent criticisms from local and international groups for the alleged human rights abuses authorities have committed in its wake. The president has recently issued an order transferring the lead authority to conduct the campaign from the Philippine National Police to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in an effort to squelch the denunciations.",

    "title": "Lawyer wants media to explain why they reported Ventura's affidavit",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 5:37pm",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — A lawyer in the fatal hazing case of Horacio \"Atio\" Castillo III wants a show cause order to be issued to members of the media for publishing the contents of witness Mark Ventura's affidavit, that the panel of prosecutors has yet to have a copy of. During the resumption of the hearing on Castillo's case on Monday, Atty. Paris Real manifested to Department of Justice prosecutors that a show cause order should be issued against members of the media for reporting the contents of Ventura's affidavit. A show cause order requires the parties to explain an incident to the court. The prosecutors said that Real, who represents respondent Bose, should file an official motion before the office of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II. Aguirre revealed in a news conference last Wednesday that Ventura, a fratman and respondent in the case, has applied for the DOJ's Witness Protection Program. During the news briefing, Aguirre narrated parts of Ventura's affidavit where the fratman detailed that Castillo's arms were punched until they were black and blue and swollen. Citing Ventura's affidavit, Aguirre said Castillo, Aegis Juris Fraternity's neophyte, was also paddled by the fratmen until he collapsed. The justice chief, in the same briefing, said he would give a copy of Ventura's affidavit to the media. On Thursday morning, radio network DzBB first reported the new names believed to be cited in Ventura's sworn statement. Several media agencies also posted the names and quotes from the affidavit. But on Friday, Aguirre issued a warning to members of the media for reporting parts of Ventura's affidavit. He cited Section 7 of the Republic Act No. 6981 for the Witness Protection Program. \"No information or documents given or submitted in support of an application for admission to the WPP shall be released except upon written order of the Department or the proper court,\" Aguirre said. \"Any copy of the Sinumpaang Salaysay obtained by anyone and released publicly is a clear violation of the law and will be dealt with accordingly,\" the statement further reads. READ: Punched until swollen then paddled: Fratman recounts Atio's fatal hazing Aguirre also said Ventura might be removed from the list of respondents in the case that now has implicated at least 37 names. The justice chief cited that rules of the DOJ's program hold that \"to be qualified under the WPP, you should not appear to be the most guilty.\" The prosecutors, on Monday, however, said that Ventura remains a respondent in the case. The panel manifested that it has yet to receive a copy of Ventura's affidavit that he executed as part of the requirements in applying for the government protection. University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law Dean Nilo Divina, among the respondents of the case, appeared before the panel of prosecutors earlier to file his counter-affidavit. The dean said he was tagged in the case to forward the \"personal agenda\" of Lorna Kapunan, counsel of the Castillo couple. Divina also asked the DOJ to drop the complaints against him. The case stemmed from the murder, anti-hazing, robbery and obstruction of justice complaints filed by the Manila Police District and the Castillo couple against several members of the Aegis Juris Fraternity.",

Harry Roque as the president’s new mouthpiece. “It is clear that the president has very sure instincts and that PS (Presidential Spokesperson) Roque meets his expectations,” Abella said in a statement.  He added: “I believe PSR will be more than adequate for the occasion and will deliver the right support needed for PRRD’s program of government.” During the press briefing before departing for Tokyo Sunday night, President Rodrigo Duterte was tight-lipped on the reason behind Roque’s appointment. “The reason is my personal decision. I am not about to explain why I did it,” Duterte said. He, however, said he is confident that Roque, a tough-talking solon, would convey his words to the public well.

When asked if what’s in store for the soft-speaking mouthpiece, Duterte responded: “I will answer you when he’s there.” In October last year, Abella went under fire after advising journalists to use their “creative imagination” in deciphering Duterte’s statement about cutting ties with the United States.  Roque will attend his first Cabinet meeting on November 6.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Dangerous Drugs Board wants to change the \"narrative\" surrounding the government's war on drugs by launching the \"Love Life. Fight Drugs\" campaign. DDB Chairman Dionisio Santiago on Monday said the board is gearing up for the launch of its new campaign \"Love Life. Fight Drugs\" that would focus on the government's \"left-hand approach\" in its crackdown on illegal drugs. \"The fight against drugs is about protecting the life of the people. It is about the life of a drug user who needs help to free himself or herself from drug independence. It is about protecting the life of people against the threats of drugs,\" Santiago said. President Rodrigo Duterte won the presidency May last year with the promise to ruthlessly rid the country of drugs and criminality. Roughly 16 months into the government's bloody war, the Philippine National Police has recorded more than 3,000 deaths under investigation, but human rights groups tally the deaths at more than 13,000. Criticism of the government's crackdown on drugs, which has subsided over the past months, reignited with the death of three teenagers, including 17-year-old Kian Delos Santos, in August. United Nations special rapporteur Agnes Callamard called Delos Santos' death as a turning point in Duterte's drug war. Santiago said the board would also focus on a \"left-hand approach\" such as \"preventive education, advocacy and civic awareness programs that aim to prevent people from abusing drugs and enlist their participation in the anti-drug campaign.\" The board would also \"facilitate capacity-building of organic and related personnel involved in the enforcement of drug laws and prosecution of drug cases, and rehabilitation of drug offenders and their reintegration into mainstream society.\" It would also tap the help of the private sector to launch national and local community drug abuse prevention control programs and projects. The new campaign would be launch in November, in time for the celebration of the Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Week. The board would also hold a fun run, an anti-drug fair and exhibit, an anti-drug concert and livelihood and skills training programs.",

READ: Grab condemns driver’s killing by carjackers “We prioritize the safety of our driver-partners as much as we do for our passengers,” the company said in a statement. “In critical times like this, we ask for your support as we take additional measures to prevent this from happening again,” it added. Grab said it ordered its driver-partners to ask riders to show a personal identification card before starting the trip. The measure is to verify the identity of the rider, especially during night shift hours.

Prior to the death of Maquidato, an October 23 Facebook post of a netizen named Carla Moreno went viral. Moreno claimed her driver informed her that he experienced a “hijacking” incident perpetrated by two passengers. The said incident reportedly prompted drivers of ride-sharing apps Grab and Uber to ask for the rider’s valid identification cards before the ride. “Upon reporting the incident, it was found out that the pair has set up a fake account and are now untraceable,” Moreno wrote in her post. “Due to this incident, some Grab and Uber drivers are now asking riders if it's possible to present valid IDs before the ride.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Last year, Grab partner-driver Gerardo “Junjie” Maquidato Jr. made waves when he did not accept payment from a sick passenger. Grab Philippines then recognized him for his deed, naming him as one of the driver awardees. On October 28, Maquidato once again made it to the news—but it was not because of another “good samaritan” act. It was because he was killed. READ: Grab condemns driver’s killing by carjackers According to the initial police report, a witness heard gunshots at around 7:50 p.m. Thursday night. Lifeless Maquidato was then seen shoved out of the silver Toyota Innova with plate number YV 7109 along Bonanza St. in Pasay City. He sustained a gunshot wound to the back of his head. The slug exited through his left eye. He was believed to be killed by a lone suspect who booked and rode as a regular passenger. The killer fled toward Cesna St. using the victim’s vehicle. Authorities were looking initially at carnapping as the motive. Investigation is still ongoing as of posting time. Grab condemned the death of Maquidato, whom they called as “one of our best driver-partners.” “Grab is one with authorities in making sure that justice will be served and perpetrators will be put behind bars,” the ride-sharing company said in a statement Sunday. But Grab refused to name Maquidato’s last passenger so as not to jeopardize an ongoing police investigation. The company Grab has reported six confirmed cases of carnapping incidents involving vehicles under their platforms. “We are currently discussing tech solutions that would decrease, if not completely hamper, the chances of carnapping incidents involving Transport Network Vehicle Services,” it said. During his Facebook Live, Grab country head Brian Cu announced that the company is offering a P100,000 reward to anyone who captures the killers of Maquidato. “I think it’s within our responsibility to do whatever we can to catch the perpetrators of this crime,” Cu said in a mix of English and Filipino. The company asked for the support of its passengers as it takes additional measures to prevent the incident from happening again. “We prioritize the safety of our driver-partners as much as we do for our passengers... Before starting the trip, our driver-partners may ask you to show a personal identification card to verify your identity especially during night shift hours,” Grab said. Cu, during his Facebook Live, said he talked to the family of the slain Grab driver. “Nung nakausap ko ang misis niya, ang simpleng hiling lang niya ay mabigyan ng justice si Sir Gerardo at mahuli ang pumatay sa kanya—ang duwag na pumatay sa kanya (When I talked to his wife, she said her only wish was to bring justice to Sir Gerardo and catch the coward who killed him),” he said. Maquidato’s nephew, Rex Mer Solitario, posted online about his uncle’s death. “Naghahanap-buhay nang maayos, pinatay niyo. Hindi [na] kayo naawa sa tao at sa pamilya niya. Apat ang anak niya, maliliit pa sila. Maaga niyong kinuha sa kanila ang papa nila (He is working decently but you killed him. You didn’t even pity him and his family. He has four children. You took their father’s life too soon),” Solitario said on Facebook. Maquidato went viral August last year for helping a passenger undergoing dialysis. A certain Divine Lacto Ornum booked a GrabCar for her sister, Prima, who was on her way to Quezon City to pick up bags of blood for her dialysis. Maquidato picked her up but did not charge his passenger out of kindness. Grab Philippines said Prima has passed away but her relatives had the chance to thank Maquidato in person during his awarding. After Maquidato’s death, Divine recalled the kindness of the Grab driver, who kept in touch with her family after the post when viral. She shared that Maquidato gave them the cash reward he received from Grab, adding she did not want to take the money but the driver insisted. “Sabi ko napakabuti ng puso nya sana pagpalain pa sya at dumami ang blessings niya kasi talagang napakabuti ng puso niya. Lagi akong nagpapasalamat na siya ang nakukuha ng booking sa paghatid sa kapatid ko (I hoped that he would be blessed because he is really kind-hearted. I am always thankful that he was the one who picked up my sister),” she said. ",

In its 2016 Annual Financial Report on GOCCs released on October 26, the state audit body identified eight state firms, including the PCSO, to have granted perks to its officials and employees without “sufficient legal basis” totaling P619.771 million. Next to PCSO on the list was the Small Business Corp. with P46.448 million unauthorized allowances and bonuses granted in 2016. In its 2016 Annual Financial Report on GOCCs released on October 26, the state audit body identified eight state firms, including the PCSO, to have granted perks to its officials and employees without “sufficient legal basis” totaling P619.771 million. Infographics by Jonathan Asuncion. The SBC is an attached agency of the Department of Trade and Industry mandated to provide technical and financial assistance to small and medium entrepreneurs. The third identified erring GOCC was the National Electrification Administration with P23.683 million of unauthorized allowances and bonuses. The other state firms identified in the COA report to have granted perks without legal basis were the Philippine Coconut Authority (P11.475 million), National Food Authority (P10.097 million), Apo Production Unit Inc. (P7.45 million), Human Settlements Development Corp. (P2.085 million) and Intercontinental Broadcasting Corp. or IBC-13 (P219,000). The Apo Production Unit (previously Asian Productivity Organization) is an attached agency of the Presidential Communications Operations Office, which handles the printing demands of several government agencies and offices such as the accountable forms and other high quality/high volume print materials. Based on the COA records, of the PCSO's P518.314-million grants to its officials and employees, P503.667 million was for “payments of allowances, bonuses, and other benefits that were not supported by sufficient legal basis”, while the balance of P14.647 million “pertains to payments of allowances that were in excess of prescribed rates.” The state auditors said the allowances and other perks were given despite the gaming firm's unsettled disallowances from the previous years totaling P1.213 billion, which also stemmed from infractions of government compensation rules. Based on the COA report, the PCSO's 2016 pay package to its officials and employees includes the following: Christmas bonus (P151.174 million), educational assistance bonus (P123.817 million), grocery bonus (P71.08 million), weekly draw allowance (P60.267 million), hazard pay given to non-public health workers (P27.535 million), revenue performance incentive pay (P23.222 million) and some smaller amounts of allowances and anniversary bonus. The COA directed the PCSO and the other identified erring GOCCs to secure an approval from the Office of the President or the Government Commission on GOCCs (GCG) regarding their questioned compensation grants. The audit body also directed the GOCCs to “submit justification as to why the payment of incentives should not be disallowed in audit” and “to discontinue/stop the payment of compensation/allowances/benefits/incentives in the absence of legal basis/authority to grant the same.”",

He added: “I suppose that I have to limit my mouth there, except maybe to bring the warm greetings of the Filipino nation, a grateful nation to Japan as a matter of fact.” READ: Duterte set to meet Japanese imperial couple Duterte, who is known for his trademark cussing and free-wheeling use of language, is often criticized for remarks that critics say are “unpresidential.” The chief executive said he intended to meet Emperor Akihito before the latter steps down. “It’s a kind of homage to the emperor before he abdicates. The last time, I was not able to do it because his uncle died. That’s why I have to go back again,” he said. Duterte is scheduled to meet the respected Japanese royals on Tuesday before he returns to the country. He was supposed to meet the imperial couple during his first visit to Japan last year, but it was called off following the death of the emperor’s uncle Prince Mikasa.

Duterte noted that he and the American leader “move their mouths in the same cadence.” “I will also have to listen to him to what he has to say. My responses would be calibrated on what he would ask,” he said. Duterte also said that the most important matter he would tackle with Trump is the issue on North Korea. Trump will be in Manila from November 12 to 13 to attend the special gala celebration of the 50th anniversary of ASEAN and the ASEAN-US Summit. The US president, however, will not be attending the East Asia Summit on Nov. 14 as he will be leaving the night before.

The Office of the President had concurred with the draft resolution that the DBM had prepared. If signed by both houses of Congress, a PO1 will enjoy a 100-percent increase in monthly base pay from P14,834 pesos to P29,668. Before Dela Rosa made an informal announcement of a possible presidential bid, he advised Vice President Leni Robredo, who has repeatedly denied wanting to become president, to set aside her ambition and instead support President Rodrigo Duterte. \"If she wants to be president, she can try but she should let the current administration and the president finish the job,\" the police chief previously said in Filipino.  — Patricia Lourdes Viray RELATED: 100% pay hike for soldiers, cops in 2018",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Families affected by drug-related killings have expressed their support for the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines’s campaign “Stop the Killings! Start the Healing” slated to be launched on November 5. The kin of drug war victims and Rise Up for Rights and for Life, an alliance of human rights advocates, has in the past taken action to mobilize poor families affected by the government's anti-illegal drug campaign. “We wholeheartedly support broad and dynamic efforts to Stop the Killings and Start the Healing,” Rise Up said in a statement. “These killings must be stopped. Families affected by drug-related killings under the Duterte administration can feel in the depths of their beings the pain of having a loved one ripped from this earth. They know more than anyone how crucial it is to stop the killings,” it added. The organization cited that families affected by drug-related killings “have endured months of isolation and have even faced a stigma of being labeled as criminals, hustlers, and generally unredeemable burdens on society.” “Duterte’s attacks against the poor have continued to fuel unfair and nasty public disdain.  Our experience bears out that the families affected by drug-related killings are as diverse and as human as any.  Their desire to be embraced with compassion is real,” the organization explained. Rise Up and the families of drug war victims will join gatherings with other families and communities to stand in them in their call to stop the killings. They will also attend a mass for the same purpose on October 31 at the San San Isidro Labrador Parish in Barangay Silangan, Quezon City.  The organization said the gatherings are essential as these are intended for families to grieve and remember their deceased loved ones especially during the All Saint’s and All Soul’s day. It added that the gatherings sought to send a message that the Church cares for them and also to make them feel that they are not alone. With the church’s campaign, the families and human rights advocate will insist that justice would be given to the slain, the salvaged and the orphaned. Rise Up also encouraged participation of each parish, local church, community, school, or organization in their call to end killings. It urged the communities to to discern how they can contribute to amplifying and strengthening their common call. “We seek to live out a noble goal to “Stop the Killings! Start the Healing!” Giving pause to recognize that under current circumstances, we should be loud, united, and firm in our call. We must start the healing.  However, when fresh blood continues to be spilled in the streets, wounds will remain open and difficult to heal,” Rise Up said. “We embrace the call that those plagued by addiction must be given venues to redeem their lives and heal their illness,” it added. Earlier, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, who took the custody of the minor witness in Kian Delos Santos’ death, said the church is not meddling in politics. He said the Stop the Killings, Start the healing campaign even offer rehabilitation program for drug users. RELATED: Caloocan bishop takes custody of minor witness in Kian slay",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Harry Roque, a lawyer and party-list representative, has warned President Rodrigo Duterte's critics that he will \"throw hollow blocks\" at them once he is officially appointed presidential spokesperson. In a video posted on Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Margaux \"Mocha\" Uson's Facebook page Mocha Uson Blog, Roque said in Filipino that he will not allow disrespect of the president to go unanswered. \"If, in the past, you were able to throw stones without anyone hitting back, be warned that if you throw stones, I won't just throw stones but hollow blocks,\" he said. It is not true that those viewed critical of the president and his administration were allowed to do so without a response from the government. President Duterte himself has launched profanity-laced rants against the European Union, the United Nations, media companies and members of the political opposition. \"Just wait for the adobe and hollow blocks that I will throw at you,\" Roque warned in the same video where he also said he believes in allowing \"the marketplace of ideas\" to flourish. \"Stop throwing stones. If you want, just help the country with the many problems it is facing,\" he also said. Roque said that he has not had a negative experience with the press in the past and that he is hopeful \"that we will work together.\" He reminded the media, however, that he is a lawyer.  Duterte made the announcement of Roque’s appointment during a birthday party for the congressman in Davao City on Friday night. “The reason is my personal decision. I am not about to explain why I did it,” Duterte said before he left for Japan Sunday evening. Duterte is confident that Roque will be able to get his message across. “He’s very competent, able, lahat na. It’s in the messaging actually. We cannot speak with the same words altogether, but how he would convey would be most important. I trust that he’d be able to come up to the expectations,” the president said. According to the Official Gazette, the secretary and undersecretary of the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson \"speak on behalf of the president and are the primary sources of information regarding current issues and concerns related to the president.\" READ: Tough-talking Harry Roque now Duterte's spokesperson Roque will attend his first Cabinet meeting on November 6. Roque teaches law at the University of the Philippines and was the head of the Center for International Law, the Philippine-based human rights advocacy group whose lawyers represented families of the victims of the Ampatuan Massacre and the kin of transgender Jennifer Laude. CenterLaw also represents victims of the government's campaign against illegal drugs in petitions filed at the Supreme Court.  Officials of Kabayan party-list removed Roque as their first nominee to the House of Representatives last January. Roque disputed the decision and stayed in office. Among the bases for Roque’s ouster was the November 2016 hearing at the House where he asked Ronnie Dayan, the driver and former lover of Sen. Leila de Lima, private details of their relationship. De Lima, a Duterte critic, is in detention over drug-related charges that she denies and says are motivated by politics. Members of the minority bloc saw Roque’s appointment as an end to his “masquerade” as a human rights advocate.  READ: Roque on being spokesman: I accepted the job to advise Duterte on human rights",

    "title": "Alvarez to Sereno: Face  impeachment hearing",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:01am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez has called on Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to personally appear before Congress so she can be given the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses in the impeachment complaint against her. Alvarez assured the chief magistrate of due process – provided she personally appears in the impeachment hearing. “She should appear because she is the accused. Otherwise, her right to cross-examine the witnesses would be waived. If she does not appear, her lawyers have no right to cross-examine the witnesses,“ Alvarez said over the weekend. Under the rules of procedure in impeachment proceedings, defense lawyers are not allowed to cross-examine witnesses, he said. Defense counsel Josa Deinla, one of the spokespersons for Sereno, insisted that lawyers have the right to cross-examine – as a matter of due process – the resource persons of the House committee on justice. “Not one citizen can be denied the due process of law in the country because this is emphasized in our Constitution,” Deinla said. He said they have filed a motion following the failure of the committee led by Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali to act on Sereno’s two letters – dated Sept. 28 and Oct. 3 – seeking the panel’s consent for defense lawyers to cross-examine the witnesses. Umali said his panel will continue the hearing on Sereno impeachment when Congress resumes session on Nov. 20 after the Philippines’ hosting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and related meetings. The original schedule for the hearing was on Nov. 13. Lawyer Lorenzo Gadon, the complainant in Sereno’s impeachment, earlier disclosed that about six magistrates of the 15-strong Supreme Court have expressed willingness to testify against the Chief Justice. Gadon, however, revealed a senior justice has taken the side of Sereno. “This senior justice asked the officers of organizations of judges and court employees to issue manifesto of support for her,” Gadon revealed to The STAR. “It appears that the camp of Sereno was able to convince this senior justice for support. We don’t know what kind of deal they had with this retiring justice who is said to have plans to run for elective post after retirement from judiciary,” he said. In the meeting with groups of judges and court employees, the magistrate cited judicial independence and asked them to issue the manifesto, a couple of days before the House of Representatives starts the hearing on the impeachment case on Nov.13. “If the justice is invoking judicial independence, why did he not do that during the impeachment of the late Chief Justice Renato Corona? We’ll just see if he’s successful and if the groups will indeed issue the manifesto,” Gadon said. Gadon did not name the magistrate, but several court insiders revealed it was Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr. who recently met with judges and court employees. The STAR tried to get Velasco’s side but to no avail. Before the elections last year, the high court declared Velasco’s son Lord Allan as duly elected representative of Marinduque following their disqualification of his winning rival Regina Ongsiako-Reyes in the 2013 polls. Sereno voted in favor of Velasco’s petition for his son, Lord Allan, who is said to be close to President Duterte.    The 57-year-old Sereno, who was neither a prosecutor nor a judge or Court of Appeals justice, was a private lawyer when she was appointed SC justice by former president Benigno Aquino III in 2010. She was later appointed as chief magistrate, replacing her late predecessor Renato Corona, who was convicted by the Senate impeachment court in May 2012. Aquino’s original choice for chief justice was former justice secretary (and now senator) Leila de Lima, but since the Judicial and Bar Council refused to include her in its shortlist, Aquino chose Sereno – the youngest or most junior among the 15 justices.  Sereno carries the distinction of being the first female Chief Justice, the second youngest and probably the only chief magistrate whose term could span four administrations – from Aquino, Duterte and two others who will be elected in 2022 and 2028. But while Sereno was the “youngest” appointee then, it turned out that her former colleague at the UP College of Law, dean Marvic Leonen, surpassed that honor after Aquino appointed Leonen to the high tribunal in 2012 – at the age of 49. If Sereno finishes her term in 2030, it will be Leonen who will be taking over the SC helm. Prior to Sereno and Leonen’s appointment to the judiciary, former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was vilified for designating young lawyers to the SC, among them Corona and now senior Justice Antonio Carpio – who were both 52 years old in 2001. – With Edu Punay",

The Comelec Bids and Awards Committee has announced it will accept bids for the delivery of registration supplies four days early. “In view of the urgency to deliver the goods, in connection to the resumption of continuing registration of voters, this BAC deemed it necessary to adjust the submission and opening of bids scheduled on Nov. 10 to Nov. 6,” the Comelec said. Early this month, President Duterte signed Republic Act 10952 resetting the barangay and SK elections to May 14 next year. Duterte signed the law on Oct. 2, less than a month before the originally scheduled Oct. 23 polls. The Comelec said interested parties may submit their bids at the BAC Secretariat Office located at the 7th floor of the Palacio del Gobernador Building, Intramuros, Manila.  Comelec previously allocated P21,374,371.83 for the purchase of supplies required for the registration of voters for the May 2019 barangay and SK elections that will resume on Nov. 6 until Nov. 30.

    "title": "Senate allots P2 B for MSMEs in 2018 budget",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Senate has allocated P1 billion each for two Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) programs that seek to strengthen micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).  Sen. Loren Legarda, chair of the Senate finance committee, said P1 billion in the proposed P3.7-trillion national budget for 2018 was allocated for Pondo Para sa Pagbabago of the Small Business Corp. and another billion for the Shared Services Facilities (SSF) program of the DTI. As principal sponsor and author of Republic Act 9501 or the Magna Carta for MSMEs, she said the appropriation was meant to help expand and enhance the capabilities and competency of the sector in support of President Duterte’s program to boost economic growth. The first program, she pointed out, would boost the continuous development of MSMEs, while the second would enhance the SSF productivity and competitiveness.  In the P1-billion fund for SSF, at least P200 million will go to state colleges and universities that implement livelihood initiatives; at least P100 million for Schools of Living Traditions (SLTs), and P50 million for the MSMEs affected by the war in Marawi City. “Compared to larger enterprises, our MSMEs are more susceptible to changes in economy, which would also affect their capability to employ and expand. Government interventions should address these factors that contribute to the unemployment and underemployment within our working class, as well as poverty incidence among all Filipinos,” Legarda explained. A 2015 survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that 896,839 or 99.5 percent of the country’s 900,914 total establishments belong to MSMEs while only 0.5 percent or 4,075 are considered large enterprises. The same study found that MSMEs have generated 4,784,870 jobs in 2015 while the large enterprises generated only 2,981,819. This indicated that MSMEs contributed almost 61.6 percent of the total jobs generated by all types of business establishments that year. Of this percentage, at least 29.4 percent or 2,285,634 jobs were generated by micro enterprises, 25.3 percent or 1,968,452 by small enterprises, and 6.8 percent or 530,784 by medium enterprises. Meanwhile, Sen. Cynthia Villar has pushed for the strengthening and creation of more MSMEs in the agribusiness sector, seeing it as a strong driver of growth and generator of jobs. Villar, chair of the Senate committee on agriculture and food, said MSMEs account for about one-third of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), as 50 percent of the group are involved in food and beverage businesses. “Thus, we want to teach and guide farmers and farm owners to engage in business and tap opportunities. We should also extend support through capacity-building strategies and make them more competent and competitive,” Villar said. The strategy, she said, works by educating and training farmers through affordable or free agri-related training seminars and courses, and by removing the barriers to their success and development.  She also cited the need to enhance their technical expertise, financial literacy and access to credit, aside from hastening the mechanization drive in the agricultural sector. At the recent 65th anniversary of the Agri-Trade Fair in Zamboanga del Sur, Villar told her audience that she has always been an advocate of entrepreneurship, believing that it is the key to economic freedom of Filipinos. Being an entrepreneur, Villar said she has been pushing for legislative measures to help small businessmen like the Magna Carta for Micro-Enterprises and Republic Act 9178 or the Barangay Micro Business Enterprises (BMBEs) Act when she was a congresswoman. “As we promote entrepreneurship and develop a new generation of entrepreneurs, we create MSMEs – a strong engine of growth in our country,” she said. She emphasized that agribusiness is one of the long-term solutions in growing the agricultural sector and helping Filipino farmers and fisherfolk. “They have the potential to become entrepreneurs. They can join the ranks of MSMEs,” Villar added.  ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has called on UN member states and the international community to “act now” and ensure long-term measures to tackle natural disasters. “With devastating floods, hurricanes and earthquakes that have impacted numerous countries, humanitarian response must be complemented by medium and long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts,” the ECOSOC said in a statement issued by its president Marie Chatardová. “Early humanitarian response has been critical for saving lives and livelihoods and the provision of essential services,” Chatardová said following the council’s special meeting on the “Aftermath of recent hurricanes: Achieving a risk-informed and resilient 2030 Agenda” last week. She said preparedness and partnerships played an essential role in enabling the quick arrival of humanitarian response and emergency supplies during disaster. Chatardová also issued a statement expressing the council’s condolences to disaster victims and extending solidarity to all the affected people and governments in the hurricane-hit Caribbean, Central America, the United States and Mexico, which was struck by successive earthquakes as well as Africa and South Asia where severe floodings occured. ECOSOC has been assessing displacements and disruptions to livelihoods of people and their immediate needs such as health, water, sanitation and hygiene, food security and shelter. It called for greater investment in disaster risk reduction, including preparedness, early warning and early action and urged for greater risk-informed investment in infrastructure and housing. “We call for stronger collaboration, connectivity and complementarity between humanitarian, development, disaster risk reduction and climate action to define and deliver collective outcomes and to reduce need, risk and vulnerability over multiple years,” said the council. It said attention must be given to the most vulnerable people facing climate change and extreme weather events. Elaborating on the measures needed in both the medium and long term, the council called for longer term recovery, development and reconstruction programs, pointing to, among others, the regeneration of industries, including tourism, agriculture and fisheries. “More importantly, key industries and livelihoods must be made sustainable and resilient to the impacts of future extreme weather events and other hazards. We must support efforts of affected and vulnerable countries to diversify their economies and harness the benefits of digital economy to enhance their economic resilience,” the statement explained. “We need to act urgently,” council members said, adding that they are committed to continue to promote coordination of UN work in development and progress of countries.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police (PNP) will implement Oplan Kaluluwa nationwide on All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day to ensure peaceful and orderly observance of these special days. PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa advised the public not to leave their houses unattended or unsecured as akyat bahay burglars might have a field day.\n\tDela Rosa said although there may be some adjustments to ensure that security measures are appropriate, the PNP has prepared templates for tight security measures on Nov. 1 and 2. He also urged subdivision and barangay leaders to form defense forces and patrol teams to coordinate and ensure the security of their respective areas. Dela Rosa has approved the recommendation of National Capital Regional Police Office chief Director Oscar Albayalde to suspend the permit to carry firearms outside residence (PTCFOR) from Nov. 1 to 15 or from All Saints’ Day until the ASEAN summit. Albayalde said aside from Metro Manila, the suspension of PTCFOR covers the Central Luzon provinces of Aurora, Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija and Zambales. He said authorities are also monitoring alleged recruitment of militant groups to join protest actions during the ASEAN. He, however, said authorities have not monitored any specific threats during the special nonworking holidays. The PNP issued tips for those leaving their homes, inside the cemeteries or taking public transport. It said it would continue to implement police visibility, mobile patrols and checkpoints to deter crimes and other security threats to protect the public. The PNP gave people some reminders before leaving their homes: lock all doors and windows and ensure that all possible entrances to the house are blocked; install a burglar alarm to alert the neighbors if someone breaks in; do not leave notes outside the house indicating you will be away; keep some appliances like radio on to give the impression that someone is inside the house; ask a trusted neighbor to keep watch over your house while you are away; ensure no candle, gas stove, leaking faucet or plugged appliance is left unattended; and secure all items outside the house such as clothes being hung out to dry, bicycles or vehicles. When going inside cemeteries, police suggested the following: bring sufficient food and water; keep in mind that liquor and food sold by vendors inside cemeteries are prohibited; bring protection against heat and rain; do not bring deadly or bladed weapons, loudspeakers, and gambling paraphernalia; closely watch items brought inside cemeteries and make sure that lighted candles will not cause fires. Remind children not to roam around, especially in crowded areas and have them wear or bring some identification; keep surroundings clean and bring own trash bag to put garbage in; know where the first aid stations and PNP assistance booths are in case of emergency or the need for police assistance; and if attending a wake, make sure the area is crime-free. The PNP also urged the public to remember the BLOW BAGETS rule when traveling – battery, light, oil, water, brakes, air, gas, engine, tires and self. Police said vehicle owners should make sure doors are locked and windows closed, especially if children are on board and avoid driving when drunk or sleepy. The PNP also advised people taking public transport not to wear expensive jewelry or bring large amounts of money and watch their mobile phones.\n\t“If you see a suspicious package, or someone acting suspiciously, notify authorities. Be wary of snatchers and petty thieves and report incidents to the nearest police assistance post,” the PNP said in its advisory. – With Non Alquitran",

    "title": "Marawi evacuees  return to site  of first battle",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "LANAO DEL SUR  , Philippines  —   It all began here. Thousands of residents of Barangay Basak Malutlut where the bloody siege of Marawi began on May 23 have returned to their homes after being forced out by the fighting between government forces and Islamic militants for five months. Regional Assemblyman Zia Alonto Adiong, head of the Marawi Crisis Management\n\tCommittee, said authorities have allowed the return of the residents after the military declared some of the areas in Marawi City safe from booby traps and unexploded bombs, including Basak Malutlut. The village was the starting point of the Marawi siege where the first burst of gunfire from the Maute group erupted following the attempt of security forces to capture slain Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was then hiding in the city. More than 350,000 people from in and around Marawi were displaced because of the conflict, which ended on Oct. 23 when troops killed the remaining Maute gunmen inside a mosque. With the eastern half of Marawi almost totally destroyed and worries over bombs planted by the militants, authorities have said it could be months or even years before most people would be able to return. “Residents of Barangay Basak Malutlut started returning to their homes today, October 29. We are thankful to the office of Marawi Mayor Majul Gandamra and all other agencies and cause-oriented groups helping return evacuees to Marawi City,” Adiong said. The military’s Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) and the regional police of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) have allowed the return of evacuees to areas already inspected by bomb disposal teams. Initial reports estimated some 5,000 residents of Barangay Malutlut returned to what remained of their village. Local officials have to screen the evacuees to determine if they are residents of the barangay. On the other hand, bomb experts from the military and police are busy deactivating IEDs left by the terrorists and collecting unexploded bombs scattered in some critical areas of the city. “We cannot compromise the safety of the returning evacuees. We have to protect them from possible accidents,” Westmincom commander Lt. General Carlito Galvez Jr. said. About 10,000 Marawi residents have been allowed to return so far, mostly those who lived near Mindanao State University that was well outside the battle zone, according to local authorities. About 33,000 others, whose homes are in so-called “controlled areas” that were spared the worst of the war, are set to follow this week, officials said. Adiong said the Westmincom and the ARMM police have secured the safe return of the evacuees to their homes they abandoned. “We are also thankful to different government agencies and non-government cause-oriented groups helping these evacuees,” Adiong said. Many of the displaced are living with relatives and friends, but tens of thousands without support networks have been forced to live in makeshift evacuation centers. The five months of fighting claimed the lives of 920 militants, 165 soldiers and policemen and 47 civilians. Thousands of buildings were destroyed with entire districts turned into piles of concrete rubble. After the remaining Maute terrorists were wiped out, the government began the full blast reconstruction and rehabilitation of Marawi. Officials said the government has received assistance from Canada, China, Germany, Korea, India, Thailand, Singapore, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Management for the early recovery and rehabilitation efforts in Marawi City and other affected areas. Additional pledges came from Australia, Japan, the United States, European Union, Asian Development Bank, World Bank and United Nations Development Program. The United Nations Refugee Agency has engaged the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) to provide identification cards to the evacuees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said most of the evacuees lost their documents in their haste to flee their homes as the fighting broke out. Even with the liberation of Marawi and the termination of combat operations in the city, a “No ID, No Entry” policy in different checkpoints in the provinces of Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur remains implemented. The lack of documentation can also curtail the ability of the evacuees to avail themselves of government help. “Very important as the response transitions to early recovery and rehabilitation for the displaced population to have identity documents so they can readily avail of durable solutions after displacement,” said Yasser Saad, UNHCR head in the Philippines. To mitigate these protection risks, the PhilHealth ID will serve as documents proving the identity of the evacuees and address restrictions to their mobility, Saad said. Lawmakers, on the other hand, urged the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to immediately issue the proper guidelines for the implementation of tax-free balikbayan boxes for overseas Filipino workers and help in delivering assistance to residents of Marawi City. This came after BOC Commissioner Isidro Lapeña suspended the rules on balikbayan boxes. Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto and Sen. Sonny Angara said the BOC must come out soon with the guidelines as the Christmas season approaches and kind-hearted OFWs want to send donations to Marawi evacuees. Vice President Leni Robredo, for her part, is readying the assistance program for the rehabilitation of Marawi City through her office’s flagship anti-poverty program, Angat Buhay. She said the Office of the Vice President has been assisting Marawi women even before the 153-day clashes began. During the siege, the OVP extended assistance to displaced residents. Robredo is set to visit Marawi in the coming weeks to personally check the condition of affected communities. Robredo called on Filipinos to honor those who sacrificed their lives during the five-month battle with the Maute extremists. She asked for prayers for the fallen soldiers and their families, who also made sacrifices to keep the country safe. “Let’s offer prayers to our soldiers who laid down their lives to achieve peace in Marawi,” Robredo said. “Let’s use this opportunity to thank our soldiers not just those who fought in Marawi but also those in Basilan, Sulu and other parts of the Philippines,” she added. –Pia Lee-Brago, Paolo Romero, Helen Flores",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Programs of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the Philippines are neither conditional nor are they affected by concerns over human rights issues. “We have a long history of providing very significant foreign assistance to the Philippines,” US Ambassador Sung Kim said at a forum of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines on Thursday. However, Kim said the weapons provided to the Philippine National Police (PNP) by the US hinge on Washington’s concerns over human rights. “What has been affected by our concerns over human rights issues is that we have been much more cautious about providing lethal weapons to the Philippine National Police, elements that are directly involved in the anti-drugs campaign,” he said. But the ambassador said the US has continued to provide assistance to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in terms of training, equipment and sharing intelligence. President Duterte had ordered the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to take the lead in the administration’s anti-drug campaign. Duterte also directed the PNP, AFP, National Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Customs, Philippine Postal Corp. and all other agencies to refrain from spearheading drug operations to avoid conflict. In January, the USAID said it did not have the resources for funding drug rehabilitation in the Philippines but remained open to discussion for support to the President’s priority program. Senior deputy assistant administrator for Asia Gloria Steele said the agency understands that rehabilitation is a priority of Duterte’s war on drugs. “They just said that’s an area they want to talk to us about but we don’t have resources,” Steele said.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Half of adult Filipinos believe only the poor are killed in the administration’s anti-drug campaign, results of the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey revealed. The Third Quarter Social Weather Survey, conducted from Sept. 23-27, showed 54 percent of Filipinos aged 18 years and above who agreed with the statement, “Hindi pinapatay ang mga mayayaman na drug pusher; ang mga pinapatay ay ang mahihirap lamang (Rich drug pushers are not killed; only the poor ones are killed).” The other 25 percent disagreed while 21 percent were undecided. This resulted in a net agreement score of “moderately strong” +29, eight points below and and one grade down from the “very strong” +37 in June. Net agreement that only poor drug pushers are killed was highest in Metro Manila at very strong +49 (70 percent agree, 21 percent disagree). This was 12 points lower and one grade down from the extremely strong +61 (75 percent agree, 14 percent disagree) in June. It stayed very strong in balance Luzon at +37 (58 percent agree, 21 percent disagree), up by three points from +34 (58 percent agree, 24 percent disagree). It rose by one grade from moderately strong to very strong in the Visayas at +31 (56 percent disagree, 26 percent disagree), up by 10 points from +21 (53 percent agree, 32 percent disagree). Net agreement that only the poor drug pushers are killed was lowest in Mindanao at a neutral -1 (34 percent agree, 35 percent disagree). This was down by 41 points and two grades lower from the very strong +40 (59 percent agree, 18 percent disagree) in June. SWS classifies net agreement of +50 and above as “extremely strong”; +30 to +49, “very strong”; +10 to +29, “moderately strong”; +9 to –9, “neutral”; –10 to –29, “moderately weak”; –30 to –49, “very weak”; –50 and below, “extremely weak.” The survey used face-to-face interviews of 1,500 adults nationwide – 600 in balance Luzon and 300 each in Metro Manila, the Visayas and Mindanao.

    "content": "ILOILO CITY  , Philippines  —  The camp of Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog is seeking to stop the implementation of the Office of the Ombudsman’s dismissal order against him while it is under appeal. Department of the Interior and Local Government officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy said he had sent a directive to their regional director in Western Visayas to implement the dismissal order against Mabilog this week. Mabilog’s legal counsel Joenar Pueblo, citing Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, said he would file today or on Nov. 2 a petition before the Court of\n\tAppeals seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the mayor’s dismissal. “But if they (DILG) can’t be stopped, we couldn’t do anything about it. What we are asking is for them to wait until we could file a petition for a TRO,” Pueblo said. Pueblo said they would just contest the dismissal order before the court. Mabilog went on leave last September and had reportedly gone abroad after being linked to drugs by President Duterte. The ombudsman ordered him dismissed for “serious dishonesty” in connection with his “unlawful acquisition of wealth.” Cuy said Mabilog does not have to be physically present for the dismissal order to take effect. On the contrary, Pueblo expressed the belief that the dismissal order should be served personally. If the person is not there to personally receive it, then it should go through publication, he added. “Obviously, we have no power to receive it. It’s a specific order and we have no authority to receive it,” Pueblo said. If and when the DILG would serve the order, Pueblo, speaking on a personal capacity, believed there would be no violence that would spring from Mabilog’s allies and supporters. “Knowing Mayor Mabilog, he’s not someone who would cling on to his post,” he added.",

    "title": "Witness in Atio hazing to be cleared soon",
    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Aegis Juris fraternity member Marc Anthony Ventura will soon be dropped from the list of suspects in the fatal hazing of University of Santo Tomas (UST) law freshman student Horacio Castillo III, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said yesterday. At least 37 individuals were charged with murder, hazing and obstruction of justice by Castillo’s parents and the Manila Police District. But Aguirre explained that Ventura, after submitting a tell-all affidavit to the Department of Justice (DOJ) last week, would consequently be delisted from among those charged. Ventura, who named at least 23 frat brothers involved in Castillo’s initiation rites at the Aegis Juris library last Sept. 17, was also given full coverage under the witness protection program (WPP). The justice chief said the DOJ has found Ventura a credible witness. “For you to be qualified under WPP, you should not appear to be the most guilty. And he is not the most guilty upon our assessment. We saw that it (testimony) was very voluntary on his part. He said he’s ready to face the consequences of his decision with respect to his membership in the fraternity. He’s willing to be expelled,” Aguirre explained. He added that since Ventura is the only witness they have at this time, his testimony is necessary to successfully prosecute the cases against those responsible for Castillo’s death. “We don’t know if there will be more witnesses. But, even if we only have him, his testimony is already strong enough,” Aguirre said. In his affidavit, Ventura named 23 fraternity members present during the initiation rites. He also gave nine new names: Edric Pilapil, Zach Abulencia, Daniel Ragos, Dave Felix, Sam Cagalingan, Alex Cairo, Luis Kapulong, Kim Cyrill Roque and Ged Villanueva. He also confirmed the participation of their fraternity president Arvin Balag, master initiator Axel Munro Hipe and 12 other members already charged before the DOJ – Ralph Trangia, Oliver John Audrey Onofre, Mhin Wei Chan, Daniel Hans Matthew Rodrigo, Karl Matthew Villanueva, Joshua Joriel Macabali, Marcelino Bagtang, Zimon Padro, Jose Miguel Salamat, Leo Lalusis, Alex Bose and Robin Ramos. According to him, the initiation started at 2 a.m. with a prayer so that nothing untoward would happen during the rites. Castillo was then asked to do some stretching exercises before frat members started punching his arms. Ventura added that they used spatulas in tapping Castillo’s arms to reduce the swelling and calm the muscles, before hitting him with paddles. After the third paddle hit, the initiators asked Castillo if he could still endure the process to which he answered yes. After the fourth hit at around 5 a.m., the neophyte collapsed. Ventura said in his affidavit that they then decided to summon John Paul Solano, a member who has medical background, to help revive Castillo. He added that they already carried Castillo to a vehicle to bring him to a hospital when Solano arrived, prompting them to bring him back to the library where Solano attempted to revive the unconscious victim. It was only after Solano’s failure that the group allegedly decided to bring him to the Chinese General Hospital, instead of the nearby UST hospital, where Castillo was declared dead.   Sen. Joel Villanueva urged Ventura to remain strong, believing that other fraternity members are harassing and “ganging up on him.” Villanueva, a UST alumnus, believes that the whole university community was disgusted with the killing, which did not reflect “Thomasian spirit and values.”  Sen. Panfilo Lacson said the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, which he heads, would hold its final hearing on Nov. 6 and would summon anew all the suspects.  Aguirre will also be invited as the panel prepares to draft amendments to Republic Act 8049 or the Anti-Hazing Law. Lacson said there is a need to formally enter Ventura’s testimony into the Senate records. During the last hearing, nearly all suspects, expect Solano, invoked their right against self-incrimination. Balag was also cited for contempt and remains detained at the Senate for abusing this right.             – With Paolo Romero",

The government has declared Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 as special holidays to allow Filipinos to commemorate All Saints’ Day and remember their departed loved ones on All Souls’ Day, traditionally observed on Nov. 2. “If the employee did not work, the ‘no work, no pay’ principle shall apply unless there is a favorable company policy or collective bargaining agreement granting payment on a special day,” Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said. Those who would choose to report for work, he added, shall be paid an additional 30 percent for the first eight hours of work, and another 30 percent for work done in excess of eight hours. “During a special day that also falls on the rest day, the worker shall be paid an additional 50 percent of daily rate for eight hours of work,” Bello said. In excess of eight hours, the work rendered shall be paid another 30 percent of hourly rate. He noted that DOLE has already issued the necessary labor advisory to guide employers and workers on the pay rules for All Saints’ Day after Malacañang declared Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 as special non-working days. Many Filipinos go to their provinces and to cemeteries to visit their departed loved ones during those days.           ",

    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "CLARK FREEPORT, Pampanga  , Philippines  —   Authorities securing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been alerted against possible “lightning strikes” by militant groups along the routes of leaders and delegates attending the summit next month. Pampanga police operations chief Supt. Michael John Riego said militant groups protesting the holding of the summit could block or flash protest signs along the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) and North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) where the leaders and delegates are expected to pass through. Riego said groups staging lightning strikes could be arrested. Lightning strikes could occur even as officials said the SCTEX or the NLEX would be closed to other motorists during ASEAN convoys.   “NLEX people did not want it probably because there would be heavy losses, so what will be implemented is a stop-and-go scheme to give way to the convoys,” Riego said. Riego said heavy traffic caused by the recent dry runs for the ASEAN event was due to “miscommunication.” He said gaps in the dry runs had been patched up and the stop-and-go scheme was minimized to allow motorists only five to 10 minutes of delay. Riego stressed the traffic interventions would only be implemented during the arrival and departure of leaders and delegates attending the event. “The heads of states would be flown from Clark airport to Manila destinations. The rest would be escorted in convoys by land,” he said. Interior and Local Government officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy, chairman of the ASEAN committee on security, appealed to the motoring public to take other routes and refrain from passing through the NLEX and EDSA during summit days. He said the two major highways would be used in the stop-and-go scheme whenever a delegate passes through. Cuy spelled out the lockdown schedules and the affected ASEAN lanes. “With less that two weeks before the event, I urge the public to steer clear of said lockdown areas so that they will not be trapped just in case there is a passing convoy,” he said. The affected areas include: the CCP complex in Pasay City where a partial lockdown would be implemented on Nov. 8 from 12:01 a.m. onwards; the SMX-MAAX Block, also in Pasay City on a complete lockdown on Nov. 11 from 10 p.m. onwards; on Nov. 12, there will be a complete lockdown of the CCP complex from 12:01 a.m. onwards; on Nov. 13, a total lockdown of Roxas Boulevard starting from Padre Burgos Ave. to Buendia Avenue will be implemented from 12:01 a.m. onwards; there will be a partial lifting of the lockdown at the SMX-MAAX Block on the same date from 12:01 a.m. onwards; at noon there will be lifting of lockdown for Roxas Boulevard (from Padre Burgos street to Buendia Avenue) on the same date. On Nov. 14, there would be a continuous lockdown of CCP complex; on Nov. 15 (noon onwards), a partial lifting of lockdown for CCP complex. During partial lockdown period, Cuy said pedestrians and vehicles without ASEAN IDs and decals are allowed to enter the above-mentioned routes provided that they pass through the vehicle and pedestrian security areas. “On days with full lockdown schedule, only pedestrians and vehicles with ASEAN IDs and decals will be allowed to pass while the general public will be denied access to these routes,” Cuy said. Riego added the Clark International Airport could accommodate a maximum of four 747 jumbo jets while others are to be directed to the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City. Security arrangements have been made to accommodate the flights of ASEAN delegates to Clark International Airport. Officials said this was decided so as not to disrupt flights at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila. Malacañang had declared Nov. 13 and 14 as non-working days in Pampanga, Bulacan and the National Capital Region in relation to the ASEAN events being hosted by the Philippines. A total of 22 foreign leaders and more or less 3,000 delegates will attend the 31st ASEAN Summit here. Among the world leaders attending the summit are US President Donald Trump, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. A task group led by Cuy has been formed to implement security plans during the ASEAN Summit. A total of 33,086 policemen will be deployed during the event. Cuy urged local chief executives of Metro Manila and Region III to provide support to the ASEAN delegates; remove unwanted elements on the streets that will create more traffic; and display information, education and communication materials that express support for the ASEAN. – With Cecille Suerte Felipe",

Reports said Quedan posed new dangers a week after Typhoon Paolo (Lan) caused widespread flooding, travel disruptions and at least seven deaths in Japan. Malacañang said the President’s flight was delayed to ensure it is safe from the onslaught of the storm. The President is expected to return here at around 9 p.m. tomorrow in time for the All Saints’ and All Souls’ Day commemoration.  While in Tokyo, the Palace said Duterte will have a series of meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and seek an audience with Japanese Emperor Akihito and other government officials.  The President will also be meeting with top Japanese businessmen in an effort to entice more investments for the country, particularly in infrastructure. Duterte and Abe are expected to discuss the North Korea issue as well as the Marawi City rehabilitation which has to be undertaken immediately. Duterte and Abe will also discuss, aside from bilateral issues in the economic, industrial, social and security arena, regional development issues including peace and stability. The President is meeting Abe prior to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and related meetings in Manila next month. The two will also meet in Vietnam next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.  Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea has been designated as government caretaker while the President is abroad.",

    "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — To speak and not to advise.   Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman of the opposition reminded his former colleague in the House of Representatives, now Malacañang spokesman Harry Roque, that his role is to speak for President Duterte and not to serve as an adviser.   “The presidential spokesman is the President’s mouthpiece, not his volunteer adviser on human rights and other policy concerns,” Lagman said, noting that “Roque is expanding his turf even before he officially assumes office.”   Lagman issued the statement after learning from Roque’s press statement that he “accepted the position of spokesman in order to advise the President on human rights issues.” “By accepting this position, I am not condoning the violence surrounding the government’s anti-drug campaign, nor do I intend to further the same. Regardless of whether I am a member of Congress or of the President’s Cabinet, I continue to value the right to life and dignity of every person and do not support the arbitrary killing of any person by the state,” Roque also said in his statement. Lagman said advising the President on human rights issues “is the jurisdiction of the secretary of justice” and not of Roque.    “The role of a spokesman is to incant, elaborate or moderate the President’s pronouncements, not to mold the Chief Executive’s statements beforehand. A spokesman reports the President’s statements but does not advise his principal on what to say,” he said.  “One cannot be a spokesman and an adviser at the same time because an advice may not be heeded, and such rejection or contrary opinion of the President must be articulated by the spokesman,” Lagman added.   Roque’s former colleague in the party-list coalition in the House, on the other hand, lauded Duterte’s “good choice” of Roque. “His wealth of experience on human rights law, international law, and constitutional law will serve him well in his new post,” Rep. Bernadette Herrera-Dy said.   “He is well-liked by the news media. He knows what they need. He knows what to say to the media. He understands the work the news media do. These qualities make him certainly qualified to field questions from the press and clarify the issues,” she said.  Dy represents party-list Bagong Henerasyon in the House while Roque used to be with Kabayan.   “Harry is also a man who likes and practices order and sense, which are badly needed now at Malacañang where some of the most bewildering and bothersome mysteries have been unfolding as how the Palace is using the many powerful communication tools and agencies at their disposal,” she said.  Duterte announced the appointment of Roque in Davao City on Friday night. Roque will replace Ernesto Abella, who will reportedly be transferred to another government agency. The President said Roque should be able to convey to the Filipinos exactly what he wants to tell them.",

Angela Lavadia, Philippine Dermatological Society president, said there are new medications and intervention available for psoriasis, a non-infectious skin disease marked by red, itchy and scaly patches, but patients are not aware of it. “About two percent of the country’s population are affected by psoriasis, but are afraid to come out and seek treatment,” Lavadia added.         She said psoriasis patients should seek immediate treatment, which would depend on the extent and severity of condition. Patients may be given topical treatments, like cream, or tablets to drink.       Lavadia added that her group is pushing Congress to pass a law providing free treatment for patients and to have it covered by PhilHealth. Josef de Guzman, Psoriasis Philippines president, said psoriasis patients usually isolate themselves for fear of getting discriminated.         “There are so many things that psoriasis patients like me wanted to enjoy, but the society prevents us from doing it,” De Guzman said.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Eddie Villanueva, founder of the Jesus Is Lord Church, has joined calls against extrajudicial killings in the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. During the 39th anniversary of Jesus is Lord (JIL) Church held at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila last Friday, Villanueva assured President Duterte of support to the government’s efforts to combat illegal drugs, but stressed that the killing of drug suspects violates God’s sixth commandment – thou shall not kill. “We support the resolve of President Duterte to get rid of the drug menace in the country. But we would also like to remind everyone of the 6th commandment – Thou shall not kill. No one has the right to take another person’s life,” Villanueva said in a press briefing. He said the drive to rid the country of the drug menace should not be done at the expense of due process. The church leader reminded Duterte, whom he supported in last year’s presidential election, of his campaign promise to uphold God’s agenda for the country should he win the presidency and of his inaugural speech where he said the “adherence to due process and rule of law is non-compromising.” “I believe the President when he said before the European Union that he never ordered these extrajudicial killings. So I would like to call on our law enforcers not to embarrass our President,” Villanueva appealed. He also cited the economic impacts, especially in terms of downtrend in foreign direct investments, of the killings. “As of Oct. 27, the dollar to peso exchange rate is at P51.80. When PRRD started on July 1, 2016, the US dollar to peso rate was at P47.001. For those who understand economics, this is very alarming,” Villanueva added. Leaders of Christian churches in the country, including the Philippines for Jesus Movement (PJM) and the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches (PCEC), also joined Villanueva in making calls against killing suspected illegal drug traders, pushers and users. They also expressed grave concern on the alleged involvement of high-ranking government officials in the trafficking of drugs.   According to the Philippine National Police, over 3,800 suspects have been killed in police operations. But the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA) contested this, claiming the number should be at least 12,000.                       – With Rey Galupo    ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Newly installed Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief Lt. Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero has received his marching orders from President Duterte to put an end to remaining threats on peace and security in the country. AFP Public Affairs Office chief Col. Edgard Arevalo said Guerrero has the experience to carry out that task given to him by the commander-in-chief. “Lt. Gen. Guerrero welcomes his new responsibilities with strong momentum from his leadership of the Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom), a similarly tall order given the area’s susceptibility from terror threats and insurgency,” Arevalo said yesterday. Guerrero served as commander of the Eastmincom, which is at the forefront in the fight against the communist New People’s Army (NPA) in Northern Mindanao. Duterte also tasked Guerrero to “sweep” any traces of the Maute rebellion in Marawi City and contain the spread of extremism. “The priorities in the area of peace and security are clear: finish the remaining terrorist groups, neutralize the communist insurgency threat, and support law enforcement against lawless armed groups,” Guerrero said in his assumption speech during the change of command ceremony held in Camp Aguinaldo last week. Arevalo said the turnover was held less than a week from the termination of combat operations in Marawi City and takes off strong with gains against the Abu Sayyaf, characterized by numerous surrenders. Guerrero added the AFP must continue with its reform programs, improve capability, and revisit war-fighting doctrines in light of new “battlefield environments.” “We will aggressively implement our modernization program and fast-track the procurement of advance weapons systems that provide cost-effective and precise target engagement, long-range and high-endurance unmanned systems, and modern air and naval platforms,” he said. The new military chief said he also seeks to refine internal processes including improvements on services and transparency and accountability of transactions. “My gratitude knows no bounds, and I think that the best way to show our President and our countrymen is to serve our country with selfless dedication and to lead the AFP with purpose,” Guerrero said.",

    "title": "Floirendo bewails expulsion from ruling PDP-Laban",
    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte’s biggest election campaign donor, Davao del Norte Rep. Antonio Floirendo Jr., yesterday decried his sudden expulsion from the ruling party PDP-Laban. Floirendo denounced his erstwhile party for its “immediate termination” of his membership “without due process” and without even hearing his side. He said the letter of termination “cited three violations which were attributed to me without asking in writing for my side on the issues.” “Worse, they imputed on me certain partisan activities I did not even have a clue whatsoever, and accused me maliciously of disloyalty, sowing disunity and discord and using media to air my grievances,” Floirendo said in a statement. Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, as national president of the party, led the signing of the letter of expulsion. Other signatories are Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, as secretary-general of the party, and Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, as vice-chairman. In the letter of expulsion, Floirendo was charged with disloyalty to the party and its leaders, organizing and participating in an unauthorized and unsanctioned party convention thereby sowing disunity and discord within the party; and manifesting grievances to the public and media instead of settling internal disputes. This was contrary to the democratic, legal, moral and ethical principles and policies PDP-Laban founders have preached and stood for, Floirendo said. “It is also notable that one of its present leaders has resorted to fabrication of stories and lies just to advance his interest and his personal crusade against me and my family,” Floirendo added. “Already at the tail-end of numerous false allegations by this individual who had benefited avariciously from our family, my being accused of imagined transgressions violates accepted rules on impartiality, which is what the party has always fought for,” he said. Despite his expulsion, Floirendo said he would continue to support President Duterte, to whom he donated P75 million during the election campaign as reported to the Commission on Elections by the Chief Executive himself. “Despite this unstatesman-like demeanor of a few, let me just reiterate that my full support is still with our President and I shall keep within me the true ideals and virtues of PDP Laban,” Floirendo said. Floirendo did not name names, but he and Alvarez are embroiled in a bitter feud reportedly triggered by a spat between their girlfriends. He and his House boss were formerly close friends. He represents Davao del Norte’s second district while Alvarez is representative of the first district. Alvarez had filed a complaint for graft against his erstwhile buddy, accusing him of still having financial interest in Tagum Agricultural Development Corp. (Tadeco) while he was a member of the House of Representatives. The law prohibits such practice. Recently, the Office of the Ombudsman, where the Speaker filed his complaint, found probable cause to indict Floirendo, who claimed he had terminated his financial interest in the family-owned business. Upon the instance of Alvarez, the House of Representatives committee on good government has inquired into the renewal of Tadeco’s contract, which the Speaker said is grossly disadvantageous to the government. – With Jose Rodel Clapano  ",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — It was “Trump effect in action,” a former United States diplomatic said of President Duterte’s claim that allegations of extrajudicial killings are fake news propagated by members of the opposition. Samantha Power, former US ambassador to the United Nations, shared on Twitter an article about Duterte’s claim that the criticisms on his war against illegal drugs are spread by politicians who lost in the elections. “Duterte says well-documented extrajudicial killings ‘fake news’ spread by ‘the guys who cannot accept defeat,” Power tweeted. “Trump effect in action,” she added, apparently in reference to Trump’s repeated use of fake news as a defense against criticisms. Power, a former journalist and a professor of public policy, also cited as another “Trump effect in action” Myanmar leaders’ dismissing reports of killing and displacement of the Rohingya people as fabricated news. The former diplomat served under the administration of former president Barrack Obama, a target of Duterte’s repeated tirades for his critical stand on the Philippine leader’s war on drugs. Trump and Duterte are expected to meet next month at the leaders’ summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and dialogue partners.      ",

    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — President Duterte wants a United Nations list of illicit drugs distributed among schools nationwide as part of educating children on the serious effects of the chemicals in these illegal drugs on the mental and physical health of their users. “I will give you a copy. This is good for the children. It is called precursors. You just digest it, International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), precursors and chemicals frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,” the President said in remarks at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Center for Brighter Beginnings here at the Davao Convention Center Friday night. The INCB, which produced the list, is an independent and quasi-judicial control organ for the implementation of UN drug conventions. It is also involved in monitoring enforcement of restrictions on narcotics as well as in deciding which precursors should be regulated. “I’ll give a copy of this to every school. Andito na lahat. Ang (Everything is here, the) chemicals,” he said, as he read out details and risks from cannabis addiction. “Other risks – sinabi ‘yan about health… Other risks – cannabis smoke contains 50 percent tar, more than the high-tar cigarettes, which puts users at an increased risk of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases,” he pointed out. “Mixing cocaine with alcohol is a dangerous cocktail and can greatly increase the chances of sudden death,” he added. The President also talked about the dangers of Ecstasy pills, which he claimed also likely contain cocaine. “Bright, moderate tablet or pills that are sold as Ecstasy may contain other potentially dangerous substances and can vary in strength and effects; may contain cocaine,” the President said. He also spelled out the dangers of heroin overdose, including lapsing into coma or even death. Effects of LSD are just as bad or even worse, he said. “They include dilated pupils, increased heart rate and blood pressure, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, dry mouth, and tremors. Some LSD users experience severe terrifying thoughts and feelings, as fear of losing control, fear of insanity, death and despair,” he pointed out. He reiterated his warning on the lethal effects of shabu or methamphetamine which, he stressed, is chemical based. He noted that other illegal substances are from extracts of poppy, a plant variety. “You’d notice that heroin, cocaine are extracts of the poppy. Plant eh. It’s a plant. So they’re not very…you know, they are grown organic,” unlike shabu, Duterte said. Duterte also said the United States had long been in denial about its problem on illegal drugs until President Donald Trump declared a national public health emergency. “As what I’ve been saying, you take time. You take time to realize. I saw it a long time ago. I was still a mayor when I saw the devastation,” he said. “One day to your sorrow, now you see, it is a national health problem. It is health really. It is law and order,” Duterte said. Trump has declared a national emergency to address rampant abuse of opioids that kill more than 140 Americans each day. He called opioid addiction in America a “national shame.” “They just declared. I just listened,” he said as he again taunted former president Barack Obama for criticizing his tough approach to fighting the drug menace. “It’s national, it’s because it affects the health. And illegal substance affects the health and affects the peace. Huwag mong kalimutan ‘yan (Don’t forget that),” the President said. Trump’s declaration, he pointed, has exposed the extent of the drug problem the US is facing. “I told you. So what’s happening to America? It is in total disorder,” he said.  ",

    "title": "More than 2,000 bombs, IEDs recovered in Marawi",
    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Government troops have recovered more than 2,000 pieces of unexploded bombs and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Marawi City while working to restore basic services in the war-devastated city. Lt. Col. Emmanuel Garcia, commander of the 4th Civil Relations Group of the Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom), said the recovered bombs and IEDs were disposed of under military-supervised controlled detonation operations. The main battle area is still off limits to civilians as soldiers have yet to completely clear the area of booby traps left by the Maute group. Garcia said even the technicians dispatched by a telecommunications firm to fix a damaged cell tower in the main battle area were prevented from proceeding to the area. “They were prevented from going inside as ground forces are still clearing the area of IEDs as well as unexploded munitions,” he added. The Maute group linked to the terrorist organization Islamic State attacked and occupied Marawi City last May 23. The Maute group depended on their stockpile of IEDs to forestall the advance of government forces to their occupied positions, forcing the military leadership to attack them from the air. The military said more than half of the 165 soldiers who died in the fighting were killed in IED explosions planted by the Maute group. The Employees’ Compensation Commission (ECC) issued an order for the speedy processing of benefits for the soldiers and policemen who died or were injured in the battle in Marawi. ECC executive director Stella Zipagan-Banawis the government set aside P2.39 million for the solders injured or killed during the five-month fighting in Marawi. Banawis said of the P2.39 million, P1.75 million is for disability benefits while the remaining P640,000 million is for death benefits.  Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito called on government agencies involved in the reconstruction of Marawi City to strive to make the war-torn city a model for the rest of the country to follow. Ejercito, chairman of the Senate committee on urban planning, housing and resettlement, said he intends to visit Marawi with Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council chairman Eduardo del Rosario and some key urban planning experts in order to assess the scope of the reconstruction effort there. He said that the rebuilding of Marawi is probably more challenging than the reconstruction effort for the areas hit by Typhoon Yolanda because this time around, all that is left of the area is rubble. “We want to do it properly this time. We don’t want another Yolanda. Marawi could emerge as a model LGU (local government unit),” Ejercito said. Military leaders yesterday commended and thanked the 225 members of three elite companies of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division that fought militants in Marawi City. Officials of the 6th ID, led by Major Gen. Arnel dela Vega, took turns thanking the personnel of the division’s 61st, 62nd and 63rd Reconnaissance Companies that helped in liberating Marawi City from the Maute group and Abu Sayyaf. The three companies arrived past 10 a.m. at Camp Siongco in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao from Marawi City. Officials of the three companies said it was difficult fighting terrorists in urban settings, but their men zealously persisted in clearing the areas they were tasked to reclaim from enemies against all odds. Dela Vega told The STAR six of the soldiers they dispatched to Marawi City – Sergeants Vergel dela Cruz and Marlon Hechanova, Private 1st Class Jayson Palma and Privates Aljon Jimenez, Ryan Tamonan and Joshua Gerald Cagud – were wounded in encounters with Maute terrorists. “Our men are lucky, none of them perished in their combat engagements there. We are thankful to those who prayed for their safety and welfare,” he added. – With Sheila Crisostomo, John Unson",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The terror threat remains high in the country despite the recent liberation of Marawi City from militants claiming allegiance to the Middle East-based Islamic State (IS), the research arm of the Fitch Group said in a report. In its latest political risk analysis titled “End of Marawi siege but terror threat remains,” BMI Research said it has maintained a short-term political risk score of 63.1 out of 100 for the Philippines as the threat of terrorism remains high. “While the defeat of militants affiliated with the so-called Islamic State in Marawi City is positive for peace and security and marks a setback for terrorism in the region, we are keeping our short-term political risk score for the Philippines at 63.1 out of 100, which sits below the regional average score of 68.9,” it said. BMI Research pointed out there is likelihood that remnants of the defeated militants might launch retaliatory attacks and some may have already started regrouping in areas around the ruined city. “We believe that it would be premature to upgrade the Philippines’ security score as the Mindanao region remains under martial law and the defeat of the rebel force led by Abu Sayyaf and the Maute is likely to inspire retaliatory attacks in the form of bombings and lone wolf attacks in metro areas, as well as more kidnapping incidents,” it added. President Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi City last Oct. 17 with the death of terrorist leaders Omarkhayam Maute and Isnilon Hapilon of the Abu Sayyaf Group. A total of 847 terrorists, 163 government troops and 47 civilians were killed in the siege, which began on May 23, prompting President Duterte to place the entire Mindanao under martial law. More than 500,000 people have been displaced. “The daunting task of rebuilding the city given the widespread poverty and lack of resources could also provide a fertile breeding ground for other extremist groups,” BMI Research said. It warned that remnants of the Maute group, the Abu Sayyaf and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) were still in the thousands and that they could link up with foreign fighters to complicate the government’s task of eliminating jihadist networks. The Marawi siege has been regarded as “the most serious attempt to export violent extremism and radicalism in the Philippines and in the region” by the Philippine government and has stoked broader concerns about the spread of IS and terrorism in Southeast Asia. The battle for Marawi is also considered the largest campaign that IS has supported outside Syria and Iraq. “Despite the end of the insurgency, we highlight that the threat of terrorism is still very much present in the Philippines and around the region,” it said.  ",

    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) will implement the dismissal order of the Office of the Ombudsman against Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog. DILG officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy said he sent a directive to their regional director in Western Visayas to implement the dismissal order against Mabilog. Cuy said the implementation of the order will likely take place next week, the earliest on Monday, as government offices are closed during the weekend. He said Mabilog does not have to be physically present for the dismissal order to take effect. “The order could be served at his office,” Cuy said. Western Visayas police director Chief Supt. Cesar\n\t Hawthorne Binag said they will implement the DILG order against Mabilog. The ombudsman ordered Mabilog’s dismissal after he was found guilty of serious dishonesty for his questionable wealth. The complaint stemmed from Mabilog’s failure to properly account for his sources of wealth in his statement of assets, liabilities and net worth in 2012 and 2013.  Mabilog fled the country on fears that he might end up like slain mayors Rolando Espinosa of Albuera, Leyte and Reynaldo Parojinog of Ozamis City. Like Espinosa and Parojinog, President Duterte has tagged Mabilog as a narco-politician. Duterte slammed the ombudsman for delaying the order for dismissal of Mabilog. “The ombudsman, in a very, very late gesture, to make it appear that they support me, they fired, stripped him (Mabilog) of his mayorship,” Duterte said told a gathering of the Center for Brighter Beginnings in Davao City last Friday. Duterte also talked about Mabilog’s affinity with opposition leader Sen. Franklin Drilon, a known stalwart of the Liberal Party (LP) and a native of Iloilo City. The LP has vehemently denied the insinuations of drug links.  “Mabilog is, I think a cousin of Drilon. That’s it,” Duterte said, telling the crowd that Mabilog has been booted out of his office. Duterte said he does not care who gets hit by the anti-drug campaign as long as he is able to do his mandate to protect the people’s welfare. –Christina Mendez   \n\t ",

    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — President Duterte granted the wish of an 11-year-old Filipino-American boy for a video message greeting him, his teacher and classmates at the Fresno Adventist Academy in Fresno, California. “I know that you are a very busy person because you are a hardworking president. I admire you greatly. But can I ask you a special favor? Can you please send me a short video clip of you saying hello to my teacher, Mrs. Ricciuti (Ri-kyu-ti), my classmates and I?” Andre Gabriel Custodio Esteban wrote on a note pad, which his mother Almyra Grace posted over social media. Almyra requested netizens to help the boy in his report on Philippine “Nationality” which is due on Nov. 15. As the plea circulated over the internet, it eventually reached Christopher “Bong” Go, the President’s special assistant, who, in turn, raised the concern to Duterte. “Good day. I would like to say hello to Mrs. Ricchuti and her students in Fresno Adventist Academy in California, USA, especially to you Andre Esteban,” the President said in a 48-second video message. “Andre, I received your letter request and I am most happy to oblige. I am sure that you are going to do a great report about our beloved country, the Philippines,” Duterte said, as he urged him to “continue to be a good son and to study well.” “May God bless you and your family and all of us in this planet earth,” the President concluded. The 72-year-old President was clad in a dark blue short-sleeved polo and standing in front of a Christmas tree when he taped his message. Go posted Duterte’s response, which has garnered more than 12,000 likes, over 280 comments, at least 8,400 shares and 313,760 views. “Rest assured that PRRD (Duterte) is working hard to rebuild a brighter future for children like you. We also hope to meet you in person here in the Philippines soon. We are confident that you will do great in your report. Hope this helps. God bless you, Andre,” Go wrote in the post. Esteban said he is a proud Filipino and hopes to meet Duterte someday. He ended his letter saying, “Maraming, maraming salamat po! God bless you po!” On Friday evening, Duterte addressed students of Davao City’s Center for Brighter Beginnings, which was celebrating its 25th founding anniversary, and told them that he is working hard to address the drug menace to give them a better future.          ",

    "title": "Arrest of trader part of ASEAN security operations",
    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The arrest in Quezon City last Friday of a suspected financier of the Islamic State-inspired Maute terrorist group is part of the government’s operations against possible terror threats to the forthcoming Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in the country, a senior anti-terror official bared yesterday. The official, who asked not be named because of the nature of his job, said agents of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) based in Metro Manila who spearheaded the arrest of 42-year-old businessman Rasdi Hamid Malawani are still conducting intelligence build-up against other groups and personalities. “Yes, it’s part of our ongoing security preparations for the ASEAN summit next month,” he said when asked if Malawani’s arrest has links to the ongoing security operations against suspected individuals with perceived capabilities in sowing terror activities during the ASEAN summit. World leaders are expected to be in Manila next month for the ASEAN summit to be held at Clark Field in Pampanga as well as in Metro Manila. Malawani, who also goes by the name Rasi Macabangkit, was nabbed during a raid at his residence at Greenfield Subdivision in Barangay Maligaya, Novaliches, Quezon City the other day. NICA agents backed by Quezon City policemen and elements of naval intelligence nabbed Malawani for illegal possesion of firearms and explosives. The anti-terror official said government agents were able to establish that Malawani took over the businesses of the Maute family in Metro Manila, following the arrest in June of the Maute matriarch, Farhana Ramoto Maute, in Lanao del Sur at the height of the fighting in Marawi City. Farhana’s husband Cayamora Maute, who was also arrested while trying to enter Davao City, died while in detention in Bicutan, Taguig City last August. Farhana, through their family-owned businesses in Metro Manila, has been identified as one of the key financiers of the attack and occupation of Marawi City, spearheaded by her now dead sons, Abdullah and Omarkakhayam. Following Farhana’s arrest, Malawani reportedly took over management of the Maute family businesses, proceeds of which he allegedly transmitted to their contacts in Lanao del Sur to support the Islamic State-inspired terrorists fighting government forces in Marawi City. One of his contacts in the Maute group has been identified as his sister-in-law Lily Zea Macabangki-Maute, wife of one of the slain Maute brothers. “Disruption operations, either perceived or real terror threats, are continuing in line with our sustained security preparations for the ASEAN summit,” the anti-terror official said. He also bared that aside from the bazaar owned by the Maute family in Novaliches, they also own other businessess that include hardware stores in Metro Manila. The anti-terror official assured legitimate Muslim traders in Metro Manila they need not worry as the ongoing security operations are all intelligence-driven, being a product of target hardening done by various law enforcement agencies.  Aside from suspected Maute supporters, the source said that parallel intelligence monitoring is also being done to determine plans and movements of the communst insurgents, in relation to the upcoming ASEAN summit. The National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) yesterday assured the public that there is no immediate threat from terrorist groups in Metro Manila despite the recent arrest of a suspected financier of the Maute group. “We have not received any information although we have been saying we always assume a high threat level in Metro Manila,” NCRPO Director Oscar Albayalde told radio station dzBB. Chief Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Quezon City Police District director, said charges of illegal possession of firearms and explosives were filed against Malawani before the Quezon City prosecutor’s office last Thursday. Albayalde urged the public to report suspicious looking persons who might sow terror in the metropolis. “We must remain alert and vigilant. Let’s immediately report anything out of the ordinary,” said Albayalde. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) will strictly implement a “no-fly zone” for drones in the areas where the events of the 31st ASEAN Summit will be held from Nov. 9 to 17 in Manila and Clark in Pampanga. CAAP Director General Capt. Jim Sydiongco warned all drones or unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAV) owners, operators and hobbyists to refrain from using them in the said dates and areas or face stiff penalties and possible confiscation. The agency issued notice to airmen (NOTAM B4588/17) of no drone operations from Nov. 9 to 17, 40 nautical miles radius centered on Luneta Park and NOTAM B4593/17, 40 nautical miles radius centered on Clark in Pampanga. CAAP said that Memorandum Circular No. 21 series of 2014 and its amendments in Memorandum Circular No. 35 prohibit the flying of drones or UAVs over populated areas, restricted areas such as airports and no-fly zones such as military training camps and Malacañang. The memorandum states that no person may operate a UAV for hire or reward unless in possession of a UAV Certificate of Authorization from CAAP that authorizes the person to operate the UAV. Owners or operators are required to register their equipment with the CAAP and secure a certification to operate from the agency. Under the provisions of the Philippine Civil Aviation Regulations (PCAR), any operator found violating rules of the memorandum will pay fines ranging from P300,000 to P500,000 depending on the gravity of the violation and confiscation of the UAV. Meanwhile, a security guard who acted as a terrorist during a simulation exercise was injured after a member of the police Aviation Security Group (Avsegroup) accidentally shot him using a loaded firearm in Malay, Aklan on Friday. Supt. Gilbert Gorero, spokesman of the Western Visayas police, said the incident happened at around 8 p.m. at the Caticlan Airport police station in Barangay Caticlan. Members of the Avsegroup were conducting a drill where the scenario is a suspected terrorist having slipped into the airport. The person who acted as the terrorist is Nhick Tanan, 29, a security guard at the airport. Malay police commander Chief Insp. Mark Evan Salvo said one of the policemen, Police Officer 2 Benedicto Etrata, 27, shot Tanan, unaware that his .9mm pistol was loaded with a live bullet. “He told us he put back the firearm’s magazine while inside the comfort room,” Salvo said in a phone interview. Tanan suffered a gunshot wound in the right chest. He is currently confined at a local hospital. Etrata, who immediately surrendered after the incident, was placed on restrictive custody pending investigation. With Rudy Santos, Emmanuel Tupas  ",

    "title": "Roque named new Rody spokesman",
    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte has appointed Harry Roque as presidential spokesman and the President’s first order to Roque is not to change his message. Duterte confirmed Roque’s appointment during the dinner he tendered for Roque’s birthday on Friday night in Davao City. Roque, who served as representative of Kabayan party-list, will be given a rank of secretary. The President said Roque should be able to tell the Filipino people exactly what he wants to tell them. “To get the message clear, I said, Harry will fit the – kasi medyo malikot ang bunganga namin (because our language is colorful),” Duterte said during the birthday dinner for Roque at the Marina Tuna Seafood Restaurant in Davao City. “He is no longer a congressman. He is now a secretary. To make his entrance dramatic, he will be attending the first Cabinet meeting on Monday (Nov. 6),” he added. Roque will be replacing Ernesto Abella, who always clarified the President’s controversial statements. Abella was reportedly offered a position in another government agency.  Abella has not yet issued a statement about Roque replacing him as presidential spokesman. Roque, a human rights lawyer, has been supporting Duterte since the campaign for the 2016 presidential elections.  Roque told The STAR he is joining the President on a working visit today until Tuesday.  “I am ready for whatever I am tasked to do,” he added. While the President said he wants Roque to tell the people exactly what he wants to say, Roque indicated yesterday that he hoped to convince the President to tweak his bloody anti-drug war and change his views on human rights. Roque explained he accepted Duterte’s offer “with the specific purpose of getting an audience with the President to address key human rights issues in the Philippines.”  “As a member of Congress, my voice is limited. Politicians who relentlessly criticize the administration are simply ignored and labeled as ‘destabilizers.’ By taking this position, I hope to be able to advise the President directly regarding the manner and methods he has used to tackle the problem of drugs. I have already expressed my willingness to serve as an adviser on the matter,” he said. He said he remains an advocate of human rights and Duterte’s statements on human rights issues “are precisely what drew me towards the position of spokesperson.”  “Over the past two years, the administration has repeatedly clarified and reinterpreted the remarks of the President. More often than not, the media and the Filipino people have looked to the spokesperson to determine the true intention behind the President’s statements. Thus, the spokesperson plays a pivotal role in confirming the policy of the state,” he said.  “By taking up this position, I intend to refocus the attention of the people more towards the fundamental position of the state, and less towards the manner by which such has been declared. Similarly, I am committing to reduce, if not totally eradicate, the impact of statements which appear to support genocide or violations of fundamental human rights,” he added. The former human rights lawyer pointed out that by agreeing to be the President’s spokesman, “I am not condoning the violence surrounding the government’s anti-drug campaign, nor do I intend to further the same.” “Regardless of whether I am a member of Congress or of the President’s Cabinet, I continue to value the right to life and dignity of every person and do not support the arbitrary killing of any person by the state,” he added. Opposition congressmen and even Roque’s own party-list group Kabayan yesterday welcomed his departure from the House of Representatives, saying Roque is finally released from “masquerading” as a human rights defender. “We wish Roque well in his job of justifying the unjustifiable and defending the indefensible pronouncements and policies of the President,” Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said. “To be the communications czar of Duterte, one has to be an expert mortician undertaking the post-mortem embellishment of the President’s crude and unfounded pronouncements and policies, and must be able to subdue one’s conscience in order to emote platitudes,” he added. He said Roque’s acceptance of Duterte’s offer “confirms his dubious role in defending the President’s wayward policies even as he is nominally a deputy minority leader of the House of Representatives.” “Roque has minimized the grave import of the unabated extrajudicial killings related to the President’s deadly campaign against the drug menace; he voted for the confirmation of the declaration of marital law and its extension; and he did not vote against the reduction of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) budget to P1,000 and even called for a zero budget for the CHR,” Lagman bared. Roque also “failed to criticize Duterte’s predisposition to authoritarian rule and intention to declare a revolutionary government and he advocated for the creation of a panel to investigate the ombudsman and recommend her impeachment for unwarranted and politically motivated reasons. “The charade is now over as Roque is liberated and obligated to be the President’s official apologist,” he added. Ifugao Rep. Teodoro Baguilat Jr. congratulated his colleagues on his new job. “As a self-proclaimed human rights advocate, I wish him luck in defending the horrendous human rights record of this administration. The appointment also releases him from the challenge of masquerading as a minority leader,” he said. Another opposition congressman, Tom Villarin of Akbayan, said Duterte and Roque “deserve each other – a principal who advocates mass murder and a lawyer who masquerades as a human rights defender.”  “It’s politically opportunistic for both as one faces imminent trial in the International Criminal Court and a UP law professor well-versed in international law that could defend him,” he said. “On the flipside, an ambitious neophyte congressman eyeing a senatorial seat thus will be riding on the popularity of someone he will always be speaking about. Kudos to both!” he added. Roque belongs to the group of Quezon Rep. Danilo Suarez, a staunch ally of former president and Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Suarez fought with the Lagman-Baguilat group for the minority leadership, with the Quezon lawmaker winning the fight. – With Jess Diaz      ",

    "title": "BI tightens security for All Saints, ASEAN",
    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Not discounting the possibility that terrorists would take advantage of the influx of passengers during the upcoming holdays, Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente instructed Bureau of Immigration (BI) personnel to beef up security at the country’s airports and seaports. During the observance of All Saints’ Day on Nov. 1 and All Souls’ Day on Nov. 2, terrorists might try to use the high volume of inbound and outbound travelers and the confusion that comes with a large crowd to slip into the country and disrupt activities in the upcoming 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit and Related Meetings set on Nov. 13-15. BI acting spokesman Grifton Medina said immigration officers in all international airports and seaports nationwide have been instructed to be doubly strict and vigilant in screening travelers.  “Our officers were told to refer for secondary inspection foreigners who have doubtful purposes in entering the country and those who have questionable travel documents,” Medina said.  Departing Filipinos would also be thoroughly screened to ensure that they are not victims of human trafficking and illegal recruitment, he added. Morente cancelled the leaves of BI employees assigned at the ports starting Oct. 29 unless they are able to present valid reasons for being absent from work. “Commissioner Morente has also alerted our personnel assigned to border crossing stations in Mindanao and Palawan to coordinate and team up with other agencies such as the Navy and Coast Guard in policing our backdoors in the South,” Medina said.  Meanwhile, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesman Captain Armand Balilo said they are expecting the volume of sea travelers to peak starting today until Oct. 31. Since they officially implemented Oplan Biyaheng Ayos last Oct. 26, they have observed that the volume of passengers in several ports were still manageable. Balilo said passengers bound to and from Manila and going to the Visayas and Mindanao might build up on Oct. 29 and 30, while many of those traveling only short routes such as Batangas to Mindoro might start their trips on Oct. 30 and 31. Oct. 31 has been declared a special non-working day, while Nov. 1 is a regular holiday. He also appealed to passengers to travel early to decongest the number of people at the ports. They should also be at the seaport at least three hours before departure time. He added that they have already increased their visibility and security at the various seaports nationwide to assist the passengers. “The bottom line here is security and safety. All our operating units have been placed on heightened alert. Coast Guard officer-in-charge Commodore Joel Garcia has also given instructions that if our personnel in Bicol and Batangas would need additional Coast Guard personnel, our headquarters would be sending them augmentation teams,” Balilo added. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and the Manila International Airport (MIAA) started implementing Oplan Undas 2017 last Friday in  anticipation of the heavy volume of passengers going to different provinces to commemorate All Saints Day and All Soul’s Day. Under the said operation plan, CAAP added security measures that will be in place to ensure safe, reliable and convenient operations at all 39 commercial airports in the country in the next two weeks. MIAA and CAAP have coordinated with domestic airlines regarding the efficient processing of passengers, especially at check-in counters and additional airline personnel will be deployed as needed to accommodate travelers. MIAA general manager Ed Monreal said that his office provided medical tents with sufficient doctors and nurses, help desks for passengers inquiries and more security personnel including bomb sniffing dogs to patrol the four terminals so that passengers will feel secure while at the airport. Domestic check-in counters will be open two hours before scheduled departure, while passengers on international flights counters may check in three hours before departure. Counters will be closed 45 minutes before actual departure time. Ninoy Aquino Internationa Airport (NAIA) terminal managers and personnel from the Public Affairs Office will be visible to entertain passengers inquiries or complaints, if any. Monreal is scheduled to inspect NAIA terminals on Monday morning to ensure that all facilities and services are ready and properly manned.  Travelers are reminded not to bring prohibited items to the airport and to stow all belongings in one’s carry-on baggage for faster processing at the screening checkpoints. A road safety advocacy group yesterday appealed to motorists traveling this All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day to drive safely, especially when they have children traveling with them. According to Einstein Rojas, a member of the New Vois Association of the Philippines, “it is imperative that motorists observe all the necessary safety precautions when driving home to their respective provinces or even just staying in the metropolis for the holidays.” “ It is important for us to stay safe when on the road as untoward incidents are easily avoidable if proper safety measures are observed,” he said. Roas noted that motorists should observe simple road safety tips such as “not calling or texting while driving, not drinking alcoholic beverages if you will drive and not driving if you are sleepy.” He underscored the importance of always wearing seatbelt and always following traffic rules, especially speed limits.  For those riding motorcycles or bicycles, Rojas said they should always wear helmets. Rojas also urged motorists to install child safety car seats in their vehicles to protect children in case of accident. With Rudy Santos, Sheila Crisostomo   ",

    "title": "Abalos bid to dismiss graft raps denied 4 times",
    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — For the fourth time, the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has denied the petition of former Commission on Elections (Comelec) chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. to dismiss th graft case filed against him in connection with the alleged anomalous purchase of P1.7 million worth of service vehicles in 2003. In a five-page resolution dated Oct. 25, the court’s Sixth Division denied Abalos’ motion to dismiss his graft case filed early this month. The denial of Abalos’ motion came with a stern warning to his legal counsel “that continued misuse of judicial processes shall be dealt with more severely.” The Sixth Division made the warning as Abalos’ camp still filed a motion to dismiss despite the court’s earlier denial of his motion to quash the case as well as his two motions for reconsideration on the motion to quash. The anti-graft court further noted that Abalos also filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court assailing the Sixth Division’s denial of his first motion for reconsideration. The Sixth Division noted that while Abalos withdrew his petition before the SC on Sept. 4, he subsequently filed a motion to dismiss before the anti-graft court. The Sixth Division agreed with the prosecution’s argument that Abalos’ acts can be considered as forum-shopping and is a mere dilatory tactic. The court said the argument raised by Abalos in his motion to dismiss was a mere rehash of the very same argument he raised in his motion to quash and his two motions for reconsideration. “The filing by counsel for the accused of the motion under consideration – a rehash of the accused’s motion to quash which, along with his two motions for reconsideration, had all been denied – appears to be nothing but a dilatory tactic or a misuse of court processes, in contravention of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and which runs counter to the objective of the rules of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding,” the court’s ruling read. The resolution was penned by division chairman Associate Justice Sarah Jane Fernandez with the concurrence of Associate Justices Karl Miranda and Bernelito Fernandez. Filed by the Office of the Ombudsman on Oct. 7, 2016, the graft case against Abalos stemmed from his alleged anomalous purchase of two units of Toyota Revo VX 200 totaling P1.7 million in 2003 during his term as Comelec chairman. The ombudsman said the purchase was done without public bidding but rather through unauthorized small-value procurement also referred to as “shopping.” Abalos, both in his motion to quash and motion to dismiss, said the case must be dismissed on the ground of the supposed “inordinate delay” of the ombudsman in investigating the complaint against him before filing the case in court. Abalos said the period of eight years (2008 to 2016) it took the ombudsman to finish its probe was unjustifiable, “capricious and vexatious” and is tantamount to violation of his Constitutional right to speedy disposition of his case. The Sixth Division, however, had repeatedly maintained that there was no inordinate delay in the ombudsman’s investigation of the complaint against the former Comelec chief. The Sixth Division maintained that the ombudsman investigation only began on Aug. 23, 2013 and not in October 2008 as earlier claimed by Abalos. The court also said that since the start of the investigation in 2013, the ombudsman has been exerting efforts to get Abalos’ side and to resolve the complaint.  ",

    "title": "Government allots P843 M for PUV modernization",
    "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The government has allocated P843 million for next year to jumpstart the nationwide implementation of the public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program, Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel said yesterday. He said the amount has been included in the 2018 budget of the Department of Transportation (DOTr). “It is a highly constructive program overall. The government is basically stepping in to assure the public a better way to commute in the years ahead, while giving PUV operators and drivers the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles,” he said. Pimentel added the operation of PUVs on public roads is a privilege granted by the government.  “This is why we have a franchising system. Those who are in the business of running PUVs have to live up to higher operating standards to ensure that commuters are safely, efficiently and conveniently transferred,” Pimentel stressed. He pointed out the modernization program is also expected to create jobs in the automotive industry, a key sector of the economy, and curb pollution. “There’s no question the shift to low-emission vehicles will help reduce pollutants and improve air quality in a big way,” he said. Under the program, all PUVs that are more than 15 years old will be phased out and replaced with new models equipped with automated fare collection systems, digital security and dashboard cameras, WiFi internet connectivity, global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices and speed limiters. A combined P2.5-billion special financing plan from two state-run banks will extend low-cost loans to enable PUV operators and drivers to acquire the newly designed passenger buses, vans and jeepneys, Pimentel said. He said the new PUVs would run either on Euro 4 compliant diesel engines that discharge 68 percent less particulate matter, 57 percent less nitrogen oxides and 50 percent less carbon monoxide, or on electric batteries that have zero exhaust gas emissions. The modernization program also reforms the franchising system to strengthen control over and regulation of PUVs, he said.  He added that fewer new franchises would be issued to PUV operators and drivers who would be compelled to organize themselves into cooperatives or firms to build up accountability, enforcement and compliance. Pimentel explained that in the case of jeepneys, each operator must have a minimum of 10 units to obtain a single franchise.  Thus, drivers running their own units would have to consolidate themselves into groups of at least 10 members to get a franchise, he said. He said the DOTr is expected to draw up new PUV routes in consultation with local government units. The modernization program has become controversial owing to the strong opposition of militant jeepney operators and drivers grouped under the Pinagkaisang Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Piston), which has vowed to stage monthly transport strikes unless President Duterte talks to them. In response, the President has warned that PUVs of defiant operators and drivers would be towed away and impounded.",

    "content": "CAMP VICENTE LIM, Laguna , Philippines — What should have been a birthday celebration ended in tragedy after eight persons drowned when their boat capsized in Laguna de Bay off Binangonan, Rizal on Sunday. Neymariet Mendoza; Malou Gimena, 39; Marilou Papa, 44; Frederick Orteza, 43; Weldy Pareño, Rolino Pareño Jr., Sean Wilfred Orteza, 6, and Jianna Jensen Pareño, 2, were declared dead on arrival at the Margarito Duavit Rizal Provincial Hospital. The boat operator, Gerson Decrito, who was among those who survived the accident, saved three other passengers. Another passenger managed to swim to the shore. They were taken to the same hospital for treatment. The victims were on their way to a fishpond to attend the birthday of Decrito’s wife when the accident occurred at around 2 p.m. Initial investigation showed the boat, which has only one outrigger, tilted and capsized when the passengers took selfies about 50 meters away from their destination in Sitio Wawa, Barangay Libis. Probers said some of the fatalities were trapped under the capsized boat, which is made of fiberglass. Personnel of the Philippine Coast Guard and Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council helped in the search and rescue operations. Chief Inspector Dwight Forte, Binangonan police chief, ordered an investigation to determine whether there was negligence on the part of the boat operator. While there were life vests on the boat, none of the victims wore them. Meanwhile, in Pangasinan, a security guard drowned when he tried to save his relative while swimming on a beach in Barangay Nibaliw Narvarte, San Fabian also on Sunday. Renante Eisma, 36, a resident of Barangay Crystal Cave, Baguio City, was pronounced dead on arrival at Region 1 Medical Center.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Makati City regional trial court (RTC) has ordered Sunvar Realty Development Corp. to pay the government P478.2 million in back rent for illegally occupying the Mile Long property since 2003. In a 22-page decision dated Oct. 11, Judge Maryann Corpus-Mañalac of RTC Branch 141 also told Sunvar to pay the National Power Corp. (NPC), which owns the property, a monthly rental of P3.2 million from June 2015 until it vacates the property.  Mañalac considered Sunvar’s payment to the NPC “as reasonable compensation for the use and occupancy of the premises.” She is referring to the several instances where the Office of the Solicitor General, the NPC’s counsel, has sent Sunvar notices to vacate Mile Long in February 2008 and January 2009. The NPC then filed an unlawful detainer complaint on July 23, 2009 against Sunvar. It was only in August this year that Sunvar vacated the Mile Long property and turned it over to the NPC following a resolution from the Court of Appeals. Aside from the order to pay the government, Mañalac also dismissed Sunvar’s claim for damages and for reimbursement for the improvement done on the disputed property.  The NPC and the government are the registered owners of the land between Pasong Tamo Extension and Vito Cruz Extension with a total of 125,607 square meters where the disputed Mile Long property is located. Sunvar, owned by the Prieto family, has improved the subleased property consisting of Premier Cinema, Mile Long Arcade, Makati Creekside, The Gallery and Sunvar Plaza, while other parts were used as parking areas.",

In a resolution released to the media yesterday, the PET dismissed the motion of the poll body, saying the Comelec should cover the accumulated costs after its failure to bring the election materials back to its office in Manila. It rejected the poll body’s argument that the ballot boxes were returned to Manila due to the Precautionary Protective Order (PPO) issued by the tribunal in Marcos’ election protest against Vice President Leni Robredo. “There is nothing in the PPO that prohibited the physical transfer of the election materials and paraphernalia; the Comelec was merely required to preserve and safeguard their integrity. Thus, the Comelec’s proffered reason that its faithful compliance to the PPO has no basis,” the PET stressed.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — For the second time, the Sandiganbayan flip-flopped on the Office of the Ombudsman’s bid to scrutinize the bank accounts of the late chief justice Renato Corona and his wife Cristina in connection with their P130-million civil forfeiture case. In a seven-page resolution promulgated on Oct. 25, the court’s Second Division reversed its April 28, 2016 ruling granting the Coronas’ motion to recall the subpoena earlier issued concerning the couple’s bank accounts. The resolution was penned by division chairman Associate Justice Oscar Herrera Jr. with the concurrence of Associate Justices Michael Frederick Musngi and Lorifel Pahimna. The court gave weight to the prosecution’s argument that the presentation of the Corona couple’s bank records would not violate Republic Act 1405 or the Bank Secrecy Law. Bank records are exempted from the confidentiality rule if there is an order from a competent court for their presentation in connection with “cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials or in cases where money deposited or invested is the subject matter of litigation,” the court said. In a subpoena issued on Jan. 18, 2016, the Second Division ordered the production of bank transaction records of the Corona couple, including those pertaining to an account under the name of the late chief justice. Representatives from several banks were also summoned to testify on the subpoenaed bank documents in connection with the P130.59-million civil forfeiture case filed against the Coronas in March 2014. The forfeiture case is an offshoot of Corona’s impeachment trial for failing to declare several assets from 2001 to 2011. The Second Division directed its sheriff’s office to freeze the couple’s assets but sheriff Alexander Valencia said in a March 18, 2016 report that only P15,000 of the Coronas’ money has been frozen. The sheriff’s office also garnished several condominium units and a parcel of land owned the couple.",

    "content": "ZAMBOANGA — The armed forces is set to upgrade is war fighting doctrine after having gained experience from the brutal, months-long battle with militant extremists in the recently \"liberated\" city of Marawi. Newly installed chief of staff Lt. Gen Rey Leonardo Guerrero said there will be changes to the operational guidelines of the armed forces, especially for ground forces involved in counter-terrorism operations on elevated terrain. \"There will be changes (to the doctrine). In fact we have already initiated steps to revisit our war fighting doctrines and the lessons learned as a result of the Marawi incident,\" Guerrero said in his first visit to the Western Mindanao Command based here. Military doctrine is considered the theoretical foundation by which forces guide their actions to achieve certain objectives. It is not considered a set of rules, but a body of principles flexible enough to be applied to different circumstances. Over the past six months, soldiers were engaged in urban warfare with Islamist radicals inspired by the global terrorist organization Islamic State. The militants positioned themselves in buildings and other structures for defense. A Scout Ranger, who was among the soldiers given a heroes welcome on Monday, said enemies were well trained and had good snipers among them. \"Just imagine, my buddy just accidentally exposed his arm for few seconds was already hit by sniper out of nowhere. The fight in urban was totally different compared to the jungle,” a member of the 5th Scout Ranger Battalion said. Guerrero said revisions to the Armed Forces of the Philippines' war doctrine will be included in future training and operations.",

A witness said Maquidato was shoved out of the car along Bonanza street in Pasay. Grab refused to name Maquidato’s last passenger so as not to jeopardize an ongoing police investigation. Grab has reported six confirmed cases of carnapping incidents involving vehicles under their platforms. “These incidents were perpetrated by criminals pretending to be legitimate passengers,” it said. Maquidato earned praise from netizens when he did not accept payment from a sick passenger in October last year. A relative of the passenger narrated the incident in a Facebook post. Grab said it is working on a tech solution “that would decrease, if not completely hamper” the carjackings. “We encourage our driver-partners to be vigilant, and to use 911 hotline for emergency cases,” it added.",

Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay and Isabela City in Basilan comprise the Zamboanga peninsula.

In a resolution approved last June, the RPOC backed the declaration of martial law and the proposal for a national identification system, saying it would address security concerns in Min-danao. Salazar said the RPOC would take the cue from the President on the implementation of martial law. “We will await the order of the President,” she said.  Meanwhile, the city government said it would honor soldiers who fought in Marawi upon their return to their respective units.       ",

Archie Angob, Vicente Baltazar and Ramil Layan were brought to the Navotas police station after they were arrested at a bingo outlet in Harrison Plaza in Manila. Taxi driver Norberto Pagnanawon, 60, said he was held up along C-4 Road in Navotas City by the three men at around 1:30 a.m. yesterday. Pagnanawon said Baltazar pointed an ice pick at him, threatened to kill him and pushed him out of his vehicle. Pagnanawon’s son, Merbert, said his father, following the location indicated by the taxi’s GPS tracker device, went to the bingo outlet at Harrison Plaza and found the vehicle. The driver then asked police officers at the Malate police station for help. He later learned from the police that the suspects were arrested while they were playing bingo. When the suspects faced the Navotas police, Baltazar said he just needed money for drinks and bingo that night. “Please forgive us, sir, even though we will have a case,” Baltazar told the driver in Filipino. They are set to face robbery-holdup and carnapping charges. Carnapping is a nonbailable offense. The other two suspects denied conspiring with Baltazar to rob Pagnanawon, saying Baltazar only invited them to hang out. The suspects said they did not know there was a police station near the bingo outlet. Asked by police what he could say to the suspects, Pagnanawon said he was willing to give them money had they not held him up. “I’m a generous man,” Pagnanawon told the suspects. The suspects said they did not win back the P3,500 they bet in bingo games after stealing the money from Pagnanawon.",

Laguerta said Phivolcs is monitoring other critical indicators such as sulfur gas output. He said the volcano have emitted an average of 441 tons of sulfur dioxide since Oct. 17.  Leveling data obtained from Sept. 16 to 21 also indicated slight inflation of the volcano’s edifice.  Cedric Daep, Albay Provincial Security and Emergency Management Office head, warned the public against going up to the crater, saying it is “very risky.”  Daep said it is difficult to determine when the volcano would spew ash despite round-the-clock detailed monitoring.   He said the provincial government spent a lot of money to retrieve the bodies of four German tourists and their local guide who were trapped during a sudden ash explosion on May 7, 2013.  “Those caught by ash explosion at the southeast quadrant are difficult to evacuate because... it is not readily accessible,” Daep said.  ",

Ampatuan’s camp claimed that the judge erred when she denied his bail plea as she merely relied on testimonial evidence without any corroboration. The defense likewise noted that the prosecution failed to provide physical evidence that would prove the suspect’s guilt, such as a ballistics reports or analysis of fingerprints and DNA. But in her ruling, Solis-Reyes noted that bail proceedings are preliminary in nature and that the court does not expect the prosecution to present all of its evidence. The judge stressed that the court is not making any judgment on the guilt or innocence of Ampatuan, but merely on the issue of whether or not the evidence is strong. Last May, Solis-Reyes denied the bail plea of Ampatuan after finding strong evidence that he participated in the massacre that claimed the lives of 58 people, including 32 media practitioners. Ampatuan and members of the once-powerful political clan were among the 197 suspects initially charged in relation with the massacre, dubbed as the single worst incident for journalists in history. More than 100 suspects have already been arrested and are currently undergoing different stages in trial. Some of them have already died in prison.

Winston Castelo said yesterday. “The LTO appears to be a completely useless agency of the government. It might as well be abolished,” he said.  He said the LTO is empowered by law to check on the roadworthiness of motor vehicles before it registers them. That is why the agency has its so-called motor vehicle inspection system (MVIS), he said. “What is the use of the MVIS if it cannot detect defects in vehicles – especially trucks and buses – before they are registered?” Castelo asked.  He lamented that MVIS personnel merely conduct “token” inspections of vehicles and do not really care about their roadworthiness.  “LTO has not made any effort to acquire instruments and technology or hire competent people to conduct proper vehicle inspection. ,” he said. Castelo has filed a resolution seeking an inquiry into the series of road accidents involving trucks and other heavy vehicles so that Congress could craft appropriate laws on road safety and accident prevention.  He noted that in 2015 alone, 129 out of 779 fatal accidents in Metro Manila involved trucks, accounting for almost 20 percent of road crashes that resulted in deaths. Trucks are the second leading cause of fatal accidents in the metropolis, next to motorcycles, he said. He said in many cases, the drivers of trucks involved in these accidents were found lacking in proper training and did not qualify to drive heavy vehicles, yet they were given a professional driver’s license by LTO.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has cancelled the franchise of the company that owns the truck involved in the Batasan accident. The board said it could not check on the truck’s roadworthiness, since that is within the jurisdiction of LTO. The truck driver said he lost control of the vehicle after its brakes failed.",

A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the victim, Senior Police Officer 3 Manuel Laison Jr., assigned at the EPD headquarters, was chasing a security guard identified as Romeo Dacuno, with whom he had a traffic altercation along Marcos Highway. “They were both on a motorcycle,” the police official said in a phone interview.

They were arrested at Barangay Datu Balabaran, Cotabato City by agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The PDEA-ARMM, in a statement emailed Saturday, said the four men were nabbed in the act of selling shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to an agent disguised as drug dependent. One of their companions, Salindatu Sabdullah, a resident of Barangay Kakar in nearby Datu Odin Sinsuat town in Maguindanao, managed to escape when he saw PDEA-ARMM personnel frisked and cuffed his four accomplices. The arrested suspects, all tagged as large-scale dealers of shabu in Barangay Balabaran, are now in the custody of PDEA-ARMM.

    "content": "LANAO DEL SUR — Authorities are now guarding high-ticket infrastructure projects vulnerable to sabotage by militants after suffering from a severe defeat in Marawi City this month. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez, Jr. of the Western Mindanao Command said on Saturday that it is part of an effort to help ensure the completion of on-going projects in remote areas in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao by its regional government. \"These projects will improve the lives of people, generate livelihood for them, give children easy access to schools and make convenient the delivery of health, education, social welfare and other basic services to them. That is what militants do not want to happen,\" Galvez said. The Maute group and its allies, the Abu Sayyaf and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, are rabidly opposed to infrastructure projects that could weaken their influence on peasant communities from where they forcibly collect money for food and other needs. The three militant groups are using the flag of global terror group Islamic State as their revolutionary banners. Police Chief Superintendet Graciano Mijares, director of the Police Regional Office-ARMM, said on Saturday that law enforcement activities in many far-flung areas are a lot easier with new roads and bridges built in the past four years. \"Securing on-going infrastructure projects of the ARMM government is one serious concern for us,\" Mijares said. Drone recordings and a matrix obtained from the Department of Public Works and Highways-ARMM indicated that in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur alone, the agency constructed 24 bridges in the two provinces from 2014 to late 2016. The 24 bridges, costing P686.1 million, now connects once isolated farming enclaves to town centers where farmers sell their farm products that in the past rotted in their barns during rainy days. The products could not be transported to markets due to the absence of all-weather overland arterial networks. The bridges were built by the office of ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman and the regional public works department, through the district engineering offices in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur, using allocations from the region's yearly infrastructure budget from the national coffer. Records from state auditors indicated that the Hataman administration spent P211.5 million for the 16 bridges built in Lanao del Sur in the past three years. Eight larger bridges costing P474.5 million were also built in Maguindanao during the period. Galvez said officials of component-units of WestMinCom based in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur where the 24 bridges were constructed have noticed dramatic improvements in the lives of local residents. \"That is something violent religious extremists are trying to prevent from happening,\" Galvez said. Galvez and Mijares, who assumed as ARMM police director only last October 20, separately told The STAR they will cooperate in securing on-going infrastructure projects in the autonomous region from militant groups using poverty, neglect and underdevelopment as talking points in recruiting potential members. Units of WestMinCom and the ARMM police tightened security last week in areas where workers are constructing strategic stretches of the P1 billion worth \"transcentral road\" in Basilan due to threats of attacks by the Abu Sayyaf. The more than 60-kilometer thoroughfare will traverse the remaining enclaves in Basilan's Sampinit and Punoh Mahadje areas of remnants of the Abu Sayyaf. ARMM police officials said more than a hundred suspects in heinous crimes were arrested from between 2015 to October 2017 in remote areas in towns that were made accessible to patrol cars and military armored vehicles by roads and bridges constructed by the regional government in recent years.  ",

The alleged leader of the kidnapping syndicate, Police Officer 3 Rodel Estonactoc, 41, of the Quezon City police; dismissed Rizal police officer Ramil Espejo, 38; former police Special Action Force commando Rolando Albios and Erwin Escobido, 32, were in a silver Mitsubishi Adventure (ABQ-6451) when they reportedly pulled out their guns and fired at anti-kidnapping operatives who spotted them along San Lazaro Road in Barangay Mabuhay at around 4:10 a.m.  They died at the scene. Police said a caliber .45 and three 9mm pistols were recovered from the fatalities. Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao, Philippine National Police-Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG) director, said the encounter followed two days of intelligence operations. Dumlao said the suspects kidnapped Chinese businessman Carlos Tan and his driver along the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Expressway in Parañaque on Saturday last week. Dumlao said Tan’s family sought their assistance after the kidnappers demanded P50 million. He said the AKG monitored the negotiations between the families of the victims. ‘We negotiated for P5 million, but the kidnappers insisted on P10 million,” Dumlao said in an interview over dzBB. Shortly after they lost communication with the kidnappers, Dumlao said Tan’s driver sought police assistance following his release in Tagaytay. The driver said Tan could have been killed by his captors, noting that he heard two gunshots before he was released. On Sunday, police found Tan’s body being eaten by a monitor lizard in a ravine in Tagaytay. At noon yesterday, another police officer implicated in Tan’s kidnap-slay, SPO1 Benjamin Pagarigan of the Quezon City police, surrendered in Moncada, Tarlac. Dumlao said the driver positively identified Pagarigan and the slain suspects. A manhunt for two other suspects, including another police officer, is underway. Dumlao said the other suspect is a gambler at Resorts World Manila, who provided Tan’s profile to the kidnappers. Meanwhile, in Pangasinan, four suspected members of a robbery gang who have yet to be identified allegedly shot it out with police at a hotel in Poblacion District 11 in Pozorrubio. Chief Inspector Melicio Medina, town police chief, said the suspects opened fire at personnel of the Ilocos region police and Criminal Investigation and Detection Group who responded to reports on the presence of armed men who checked into the hotel. No one was reported hurt among the law enforcers. Medina said assorted firearms and a black Toyota Fortuner with no license plates were recovered from the fatalities. – With Eva Visperas",

LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada said they issued a preventive suspension order on Golddust Transportation Services after one of its trucks carrying steel posts plowed through eight vehicles along the Batasan-San Mateo Road in Barangay Batasan Hills. Lizada said they would summon the operator of the trucking firm to a hearing on Dec. 5 to explain why its franchise should not be suspended or revoked.  The operator’s franchise is valid until 2018. Lizada said they could not comment on the roadworthiness of the truck as the matter is within the authority of the Land Transportation Office.

Police identified the fatalities as Ludivina Baluyot, Bureau of Fire personnel Enrique Faigane, Eduardo Herbas, Lady Christy Pullido and Nida Gersalia.  Fourteen others were injured and taken to nearby hospitals.

Truck driver Nilo Calimutan is being held at the Quezon City Police District Traffic Sector 5 on charges of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide and damage to property.   Investigators said the truck lost its brakes and crashed into the other vehicles before toppling on its side.  The truck’s gears reportedly failed due to the weight of its load, prompting Calimutan to lose control of the vehicle.  The accident caused a monstrous traffic jam in the area.                   ",

DILG officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy advised the public to avoid the southbound lanes of EDSA, North Luzon Expressway and Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway as well as the north and southbound lanes of Roxas Boulevard. Cuy said these roads would be used for the convoy rehearsals from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. tomorrow. The final dry run involves the deployment of route marshals, he said. “Seamless traffic flow is critical to the ASEAN activities. We appeal for public cooperation,” Cuy said.",

Unson said the gesture was his expression of his love for the country and citizens and of his sympathy to the fallen soldiers and police officers of the Marawi conflict. “Most importantly, [this gesture is] to suit my desire to help protect the country’s tri-people and visiting foreigners and immigrants from harm that violent religious extremists can do using improvised explosive devices,” he said in his deed of donation.

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III yesterday said he implemented the dismissal order recently issued by the Office of the Ombudsman against Ma. Asuncion Isabel Gargalicano of Guimbal town after she was found guilty of grave misconduct. The ombudsman also ordered Gargalicano’s perpetual disqualification from holding public office, the cancellation of her eligibility and forfeiture of her retirement benefits. Graft probers said Gargalicano connived with former mayor Oscar Garin Jr. and other municipal employees in the anomalous procurement of liquid organic fertilizers from Feshan Philippines Inc. amounting to P3 million. Investigation showed no public bidding was conducted and the fertilizer was overpriced by P1,500 per bottle. Former Sorsogon governor Raul Lee is so far the highest local government official convicted over the fertilizer scam. He was sentenced to a maximum of 40 years in prison last August. The Department of Finance said the ombudsman suspended three other officials for various violations. Onofre Natividad, municipal treasurer of South Upi in Maguindanao, was suspended for three months for failing to remit the Pag-IBIG and Government Service Insurance System contributions as well as witholding tax of local government employees from January to December 2007. Eduardo Pagulayan Jr., Bureau of Internal Revenue-Ilocos acting director, was suspended for one month for failing to reinstate Marina de Guzman as regional director. The Court of Appeals reversed an ombudsman ruling dismissing De Guzman in May last year. Meanwhile, Jacinto Villaviray, security guard at the Bureau of Customs, was also suspended for three months by the Civil Service Commission for failing to file his statement of assets, liabilities and net worth for 2014.",

Alleged pedophile Robin Hoyt Alderman, 58, a yoga instructor, reportedly contacted through social media three minors, aged 14 and 15, who were reportedly willing to perform lewd acts with the foreigner. However, law enforcers arrested Alderman upon his arrival at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 2 on Oct. 15 following a tip from the United States Homeland Security after a social media provider informed the US government of Hoyt’s activities. Police charged him with violation of Republic Act 10365 or the Expanded Anti-Human Trafficking Law before the Department of Justice last Oct. 19. Senior Superintendent Villamor Tuliao, who heads the WCPC Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division, said they have the names of the victims, who are from Manila. The online conversation between Alderman and the minors were graphic and showed the girls were willing victims. “What he wants to do with the victims were just like those from ‘50 Shades of Grey,’” Tuliao said. The suspect planned to rent an apartment where he will document their activities. He also told the three minors of his plan to buy a van and a motorcycle, which he will use to abduct homeless children whom he will sexually abuse, Tuliao said. Seized from Alderman’s possession were assorted sex toys, mobile phones, a laptop, face masks and pills. “We have reasons to believe that aside from his sexual perversion, he is also making videos which he will sell,” Tuliao said.              ",

The two new witnesses said their conscience bothered them and they wanted to tell the truth: that Arnaiz’s death was the result of a shootout. “Isipin na din po natin na ginagawa ng mga pulis yung trabaho nila tapos ganyan pa ang mangyayari (Just think that the police officers are just doing their jobs and then this happens),” the female witness said in a television interview over GMA News. The couple, who were riding a tricycle, said they had just dropped off a passenger when they saw two men pursuing a man clad in a black jacket along C-3 Road at around 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 18. The male witness claimed the two men, whom he said were police officers, were shouting at the man. The couple said the man in a black jacket pulled out a handgun and shot at the policemen. They hid for 10 minutes until the gunfire subsided. They said it was only in news reports they learned the gunman was Arnaiz. Senior Superintendent Wilson Asueta, who heads the CIDG-NCR, said the two have yet to execute their affidavits. “They will return. We need to further validate and evaluate their statements,” Asueta said in a text message. Arnaiz’s parents filed charges of double murder, torture and planting of evidence against Police Officers 1 Ricky Arquilita and Jeffrey Perez before the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the deaths of Arnaiz and his companion, 14-year-old Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman, whose body was found in Nueva Ecija with 28 stab wounds. The policemen sought the dismissal of charges against them in a joint rejoinder affidavit submitted to the DOJ yesterday. They insisted that Arnaiz was killed in a shootout after he allegedly robbed taxi driver Tomas Bagcal along C-3 Road. The policemen reiterated that the incident took place at around 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 18 – contrary to an eyewitness account and forensic exam results that Arnaiz was killed at around 1:30 a.m. Their account, however, was rebutted by the earlier testimony of the eyewitness who said that there was no shootout and Arnaiz even begged for his life when he was shot by the police officers. The DOJ is set to hold a final hearing on Nov. 7 before submitting the case for resolution.",

In a three-page decision dated September 27, the COA Commission Proper has affirmed with finality the Notice of Disallowance issued by its Regional Office VII in May 2013 in connection with the purchase of the personalized calendars. The COA said Chatto and the four other provincial officials filed their joint appeal before Commission Proper nine days beyond the 180-day period provided under the COA rules of procedure, thus the decision of its regional office “shall become final and executory.” While the COA decision did not explicitly identify whose image appears in the calendars, the commission said the purchase was “contrary” to the Department of the Interior and Local Government Memorandum Circular No. 308-97 which urges all local officials “to reflect on their personalized calendars the pictures of their completed projects where human resource development is a major component instead of their pictures.” The COA also cited Administrative Order No. 103 Series of 2004 which suspends the spending on paid media advertisements except for those related to announcement of agency guidelines, rules and regulations, conduct of public bidding or dissemination of important public advisories. The audit body said Bohol government's purchase of the personalized calendars also violated COA Circular No. 85-055-A which prohibits “unnecessary” expenditures or uses of funds and property, including those for “advertisements of anniversaries, etc. in newspapers, TV, or radio merely for publicity or propaganda purposes.” The decision was signed by COA chairman Michael Aguinaldo and commissioners Jose Fabia and Isabel Agito. Aside from Chatto, also directed to jointly return the P2.437-million provincial fund were former Vice Gov. Concepcion Lim, provincial administrator Alfonso Damalerio II, provincial treasurer Eustaquio Socorin, provincial accountant Joseth Celocia and requisitioning office head Gabino Redulla.",

Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio will be gunning for a seat at the House of Representatives while Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte announced that he is retiring from politics in 2019. Paolo said that he will go back to farming and focus more on his family as he prepared for retirement. He said that his children were affected by the allegations thrown against him by Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, who accused him of being involved in the smuggling of a P6.4-billion shabu shipment from China. The vice mayor however said there would still be a Carpio-Duterte tandem in the city as the mayor 's husband, lawyer Manases “Mans” Carpio, might run for office. \"When Mayor Sara announced that she will file for a congressional seat in the 1st District, everybody's asking me where I am going. It will still be a Carpio-Duterte tandem in the mayor and vice mayor, we are still talking to the other Duterte, but definitely, it will not be me,\" Paolo said in a release. Paolo said that Carpio is \"very qualified\" to lead Davao City because of his background as a lawyer. Talks are also ongoing with Sebastian \"Baste\" Duterte regarding his plans for the 2019 local polls. Mayor Duterte first made her announcement to seek a congressional post at the launch of the Tapang at Malasakit Alliance for the Philippines in Taguig City on Monday. “I do not have plans of running [for] a national post in the 2019 elections. But I have plans of running in the first congressional district of Davao City,” Sara said Monday to dismiss rumors that she is eyeing a senatorial seat. Rep. Karlo Alexei Nograles, a Duterte ally, is congressman for the 1st District of Davao City.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The parents of Kian Loyd delos Santos yesterday sought the indictment of 12 former Caloocan policemen for the killing of the victim last August. In a preliminary investigation, Saldy and Lorenza delos Santos asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) to charge the additional respondents. They asked the investigating panel of prosecutors to reject the defense of the police officers that they could not be held liable for Kian’s murder. Represented by Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) chief Persida Rueda-Acosta, the complainants said the respondents were part of the police team that allegedly killed Kian in a supposed anti-drug operation in Caloocan on Aug. 16. “The Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Services in its conduct of a motu-propio investigation of the incident, found the respondents liable for the death of Kian,” read the petition. “From the foregoing, the herein respondents cannot deny the fact that the PNP-IAS has ruled out their claim that the operation was legitimate,” it added. The respondents are Police Officers 2 Arnel Canezares, Diony Corpuz and Fernan Cano, and PO1s Reynaldo Dan Blanco Jr., Silverio Garcia Jr., Ronald Herrera, Myrldon Yagi, Christian Joy Aguilar, Ceferino Paculan, J-Rossillini Lorenzo, Erwin Romeroso and Ferdinand Claro. They are facing charges of murder, torture, planting of evidence and violation of domicile under Article 128 of the Revised Penal Code. The panel of prosecutors headed by Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Tofel Austria ordered the respondents to submit their rejoinder tomorrow. Only four police officers were named in the initial complaint. They were Chief Inspector Amor Cerillo, PO3 Arnel Oares and PO1s Jeremiah Pereda and Jerwin Cruz, all former members of the Caloocan police community precinct 7. A total of 16 witnesses have been presented by the National Bureau of Investigation to support the charges against the four. The PAO also submitted to the DOJ closed-circuit television footage and the results of the forensic examination on Kian, which showed that he was lying face down when shot three times.",

On Tuesday, 18 members of the Guerrilla Front 73 in Senator Ninoy Aquino and Kalamansig towns in Sultan Kudarat surrendered on Tuesday. The NPA guerrillas turned over their firearms and four improvised bombs each weighing more than two kilos to the 33rd Infantry Battalion (IB). The rebels were presented to Mayors Randy Ecija and Ronan Garcia of Senator Ninoy Aquino and Kalamansig, respectively, who promised to provide livelihood and relief assistance to the rebel-returnees.   Five of those who surrendered to the 57th IB last week belonged to the Guerrilla Front 53 also based in Kalamansig. The rebels complained of their “difficult life”due to the government’s relentless campaign against communist insurgents and infighting among NPA leaders, Maj. Gen. Arnel dela Vega of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division said yesterday. Col. Edgard Arevalo, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) public affairs office chief, said the surrenders affirmed the success of “focused military operations complemented by intelligence and civil-military efforts.” Last Oct. 1, Alex Gawelan, alias Banate, a ranking member of the Guerrilla Front 53, surrendered to the 39th IB in Arakan, North Cotabato. Several NPA guerrillas also surrendered in Abra, Surigao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Norte, Compostela Valley, Occidental Mindoro and Cagayan.  Arevalo said 14 high-powered firearms were recovered from 30 rebels who surrendered from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16. Aside from over 400 rebels who surrendered since January, the AFP said 121 were killed in military operations while 71 were arrested. The rebels yielded more than 300 firearms.  The military said it achieved significant gains in the campaign against communist insurgency since peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front were suspended last February. “Our incessant combat, intelligence and civil military operations are now bearing fruit as more and more NPA rebels are now returning to the fold of the law,” AFP chief Gen. Eduardo Año said.",

Health Secretary Dr. Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubial said at the launch of the Philippine Global Adult Tobacco Survey on Friday that they would await the results of the pilot before making plans for a second iteration. \"Right now, it is still under surveillance and we will convene a technical working group to discuss how we will move forward with this particular vaccination program,\" Ubial explained. All data from the vaccination program will be collated after the administration of the third dose and will be evaluated after a six-month observation period by a national technical advisory group (NTAG). Formed in August 2016, NTAG's panel of independent experts from the academe and the scientific community will evaluate the adverse effects of the vaccine and community data to plot the next step for the program. \"Antayin natin yung results ng adverse events and also the results of siguro, implementation kasi affected rin dun yung mga beliefs, perspectives ng mga parents, kung ayaw nila magpabakuna and all that,\" Ubial said. \"We know that the medical community is divided on this issue. Hindi pa rin, parang, accepted in all the medical fields,\" she added. The health department will also wait for additional funds for the controversial program implemented by her predecessor, Dr. Janette Garin, for P3.5 billion. \"Wala pa tayong naka-plano at tsaka wala pang budget for continuing the program so we're awaiting the recommendation of the NTAG,\" Ubial said. \"Wala pang identification of how we move forward, who will be the next targets for vaccination. Wala pa sa GAA.\" Ubial questioned the timing of the dengue vaccination program at a House health committee hearing last December when legislators probed the DOH's procurement of Dengvaxia. The Senate similarly conducted its own investigation into the purchase. Around 489,003 Grade 4 students in public schools from the National Capital Region (NCR), Calabarzon, and Central Luzon were estimated to have received their second shots in October. Students will be fully inoculated after receiving their third shot, to be administered from April to July this year, as each dose requires a six-month interval between each shot.

In a press briefing at the Department of Health, Tayag said the second of three doses for Grade 4 students aged nine and above will be administered despite rumors of the newly-approved vaccine having negative side-effects. \"Gusto naming linawin po dito na yung ganun po ay na-obserbahan nila sa vaccine trial, dun sa mga bata na maaga nilang binigyan ng bakuna. Kaya nga ang rekomendasyon sa amin ng WHO (World Health Organization), kung i-introduce namin yung vaccine, ay sa mga bata lamang nine and above,\" Tayag said. The only adverse reaction to the dengue vaccine observed in the first round of the health department's inoculation program in April is irritation and pain around the injection site and possible introduction of dengue if the vaccinated child is younger than nine. \"Bakit po yun (age limit)? Kung ang bakuna po- kasi virus po yun- kung ang bakuna ang unang exposure niya sa dengue virus, at bago niya ma-kumpleto yung bakuna, magkaroon siya ng natural infection sa dengue, dun nila na-obserbahan nagkaroon ng dengue illness na severe na,\" Tayag explained.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health is urging mothers to bring their children to health centers starting Thursday, January 23, as the department expands its measles catch-up vaccination campaign. The expanded drive wil cover two million Filipino children in Metro Manila and 7 other provinces. The campaign, which began at the start of the year, will now include children aged 6 months to 3 years in Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon, Bulacan, and Pampanga. These areas, some of which are close to outbreak areas, reported an increase in the number of measles cases or deaths among children 3 years old and below, the health department said in a statement Tuesday, January 21. Some communities in these areas also have low vaccine coverage, high population density, and high population mobility. Measles is a viral and highly-contagious respiratory disease. Infected persons exhibit symptoms such as high fever, red eyes, runny nose, and cough. Rashes appear throughout the body after two days. The illness can be spread through cough or direct contact with body secretions of an infected person. A person with measles can pass the disease on to 18 other people. Only in health centers The vaccination of children aged 6 months old is only recommended for places with an outbreak. This is 3 months earlier than the prescribed age for the first vaccine (9 to 11 months) which they should still get, as well as the booster shot at 15 months old. The first vaccine is 90% effective, while the booster is 100% effective, DOH Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag earlier said. In normal conditions, 6 months old is too early for a measles vaccination because maternal antibodies still persist in the baby, rendering the vaccine useless. During the campaign period, which will run until February 3, only health centers in the 8 areas will provide free measles shots from Mondays to Fridays, from 8 am to 12 noon. Other health services will also be available to mothers and their families. In areas with low turnouts at health centers, local government units (LGUs) may deploy their teams to prevent further outbreaks of the communicable disease. (READ: Ona: Take health care out of politicians' hands) Heath Secretary Enrique Ona also reminded LGUs to strengthen other routine immunizations for children. A nationwide measles and oral polio vaccination will be conducted for the whole month of September, targeting 13 million Filipino children.

On Monday, September 1, President Benigno Aquino III appealed to the public to take part in the mass immunization campaign, which aims to achieve at least 95% vaccination coverage at all administrative levels. Some areas still have a less than 50% vaccination rate, the President said when he graced the launch of the month-long campaign at the Department of Health (DOH) compound in Manila. He also said 11-13 million of children are at risk of polio and measles. “The DOH will do all it can but, of course, we need to cooperate with all local government units,” Aquino said. “And the most important thing is the parents themselves who care for their kids, they should be the first [to go] to ensure all our children get vaccinated, so they can truly be protected from this illness that can easily be prevented if we all help one another.” Aquino said the government gave the DOH enough funds in order to achieve the 95% vaccination goal.

The nationwide campaign is a followup to the DOH’s 2011 Measles Rubella Supplemental Immunization Activity, which aims to interrupt measles transmission. The Rubella Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) was added in this year’s campaign to hamper the spread of wild polio virus in the country through importation from other countries. All children from 9 months to about 5 years old are required to get vaccinated, as data shows most cases from 2013 to early 2014 are under 5 years old. Many are unvaccinated.

Ito ay ginawa sa Cebu and also here sa NCR (It was done in Cebu and also in the National Capital Region) in 4 cities. So they have started the vaccination,\" said Cruz on the sidelines of Allied Against Dengue's roundtable discussion on Wednesday, August 23.\nTo get the vaccine, the child must be accompanied by his or her parent. The child must not have any other sickness to qualify him or her for the vaccine. (READ: World's first dengue vaccine now available in PH)\nLatest DOH data show that 43,470 dengue cases were reported nationwide from January 1 to July 1, which is 36.8% lower than the figure during the same period last year.\nCruz said Cebu and the 4 cities in NCR – Caloocan, Makati, Manila, Quezon City – were chosen because these areas recorded the highest number of cases. Cebu reported the highest number of dengue cases at 6,281, while NCR as a whole reported 5,567 cases.\nActivation manager Randy Silva of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Philippines said they conducted a survey in May regarding Filipinos' awareness of dengue. His company is part of Allied Against Dengue.\n\"And here we actually saw that there's still a big gap in terms of how people perceive dengue and also the misconceptions that they hold,\" said Silva.\n\"For example, 80% think there is a cure to dengue. There's actually no cure. There's a vaccine but when you actually have dengue, the only thing you can really do is manage it. Sixty-nine percent think antibiotics actually help the body, but we know antibiotics are only for bacterial infections,\" said Silva.\nHe added less than half of Filipinos are aware of dengue's symptoms, including on-and-off fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, and nausea. Only 42% of Filipinos, said Silva, are aware that dengue patients should only be taking paracetamol.\nDengue patients are also advised to drink lots of fluid to manage the disease.\nCruz said this is why the DOH and groups like Allied Against Dengue continue their information campaigns on dengue.\n\"Sa ating pong kababayan, sa buong Pilipinas, we are encouraging you na kuhanin ang tamang impormasyon tungkol sa dengue.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Moms can usually tell right away when their child is feeling under the weather, and they usually know exactly what to do to lift his or her spirits. A little medicine, a helping of his or her favorite dish, and some rest is usually all it takes to get your child up and playing again (READ: Fighting a child's fever: A gameplan for moms), but what if your tried and tested techniques suddenly aren’t working?\nIf you’ve been treating your child’s fever but he or she doesn’t seem to be getting any better, it’s possible that the child has dengue, and not just flu. Pediatrician, Salvacion Gatchalian says, \"The signs and symptoms associated with dengue are very nonspecific. That's why you always rule out if this could be a systemic viral infection.\"\nDengue fever is rampant during the rainy season so be extra cautious this time of the year (READ: How to dengue proof yourself and your home). If your child is suffering from a fever you can’t seem to break, it might be dengue you’re dealing with.\nWhat is dengue fever?\nDengue is contracted when a mosquito that has one of four dengue viruses bites a person. It cannot be directly contracted from another person.\nDengue fever can go from mild to severe, having a wide spectrum of symptoms like fever, rashes and joint pains. Bleeding in the nose and gums may also happen if the dengue develops into more sever forms like dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).\nThose with a weakened immune system or ones who have already had dengue have a higher risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever but the good news is that usually, younger children only experience milder cases.\nTry to back track\nTo figure out if it’s dengue you’re dealing with, think back and try to remember if your child could have been exposed to mosquitoes in the past five to seven days. Maybe he or she went on a school camping trip or has been playing by a fountain at the nearby park? Dengue mosquitoes abound in stagnant water so any wet area could be a possible breeding ground. If you find out that your child has indeed been hanging around areas like these, there’s a higher chance it is dengue fever that has been contracted.\nHow is your child feeling?\nAll cases of dengue have fever as a symptom but if your child’s temperature fluctuates from high to low, this would be an even bigger indication. Other signs to watch out for are headaches, pain behind the eyes, a sore throat, abdominal pain, and nausea. Check and see too if your little one is looking flushed. If this does not usually happen when he or she has the flu, it could be because of dengue.\nTreat these symptoms like you would any type of virus but Dr. Gatchalian urges mothers to keep in mind that if their child does not respond to medication in the first 48 hours, it is time to head for the hospital.\nVisiting a doctor\nIf you suspect that your child has dengue, the best thing to do is to visit a doctor.\nYour physician may hold tests like the tourniquet test wherein your child’s blood pressure is taken with the cuff inflated for about five minutes, they will then count how many petechiae or red spots there are on the skin. If there are 10 or more per 1 square inch, this is a sign of dengue. But this test is not 100% accurate so they usually consult a CBC or complete blood count as well.\nYou can never be too sure when only relying on symptoms so these tests will help determine the proper actions to take for your child to get better.\nProper treatment\nThe treatment for dengue varies depending on which form your child is experiencing. While the more serious ones could lead to hospitalization for easy monitoring of your child’s platelet count and hydration, milder forms are much simpler to treat. Just like a regular flu, your child’s condition can improve with constant water intake and by taking an antipyretic like paracetamol. Since it could increase the chances or worsen bleeding, avoid any medicine with aspirin or ibuprofen.\nDengue fever is easier to treat when caught in its earlier stages so if you suspect that your child has contracted the virus, take note of these signs, visit your pediatrician, and be one step ahead.\n",

The vaccine is recommended for all healthy individuals aged 9 years old to 45 years old.\n\"We need to cover more patients na makataas sana yung coverage rate para magkaroon ng greater impact sa reduction ng disease (We need to cover more patients so we can increase our coverage rate so that this will have a greater impact on the reduction of the disease),\" she told Rappler.\nThis number does not include the 3 million doses needed to vaccinate 1 million children, based on the target of the health department.\nThe launch of the vaccine in the Philippines is apt, given that the country is among countries in the Western Pacific region with the highest incidence of dengue in recent years.\nDengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito. Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), as many as 400 million people are infected with dengue worldwide every year, two-thirds of which are in Asia.\nCiting a local study done by a professor at the University of San Carlos in Cebu City, Dr Rose Capeding of the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine said the total annual disease cost of dengue was estimated at P16.7 billion.\nAlthough Santos refused to disclose the price of the vaccine, medical experts assured the public it will be \"affordable and reasonable.\"\n\"We pediatricians and physicians realize the burden of dengue and definitely, the price is going to be very affordable and reasonable. Our aim is to protect our patients – as much as possible we don't want them to get hospitalized. Preventive care is actually primary in in the services we provide our patients,\" said Dr. Sally Gatchalian, president of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines.\nThe vaccine, which provides protection from all 4 dengue strains, will be given in 3 doses at 6-months interval. Systemic reactions to the vaccine include fever, headache, muscle pains, joint pains, and weakness.\n\"The vaccine has been looked into in terms of its efficacy, from the time the child was injected with the first dose until after receiving 3 doses, the vaccine was shown to be effective,\" Capeding explained.\nIt took more than 20 years to develop the vaccine, which boasts of 65.6% reduction in symptomatic dengue, 93.2% reduction in severe form of dengue, and 80.8% reduction in hospitalization due to dengue.",

(GSKCH) joined forces with other organizations in the Philippines including the Department of Health (DOH), Philippine Pharmacists Association (PPHA), Mercury Drug Corporation, SmartParenting.com.ph, and CNN Philippines in a united effort to support the nation to defeat dengue.\nAllied Against Dengue (AAD) was created as a non-profit open platform with the aim to empower healthcare providers, organizations and communities, as well as to reduce the impact of dengue on the nation in a holistic manner from prevention and control to management.\nDengue is the fastest-growing vector-borne infection in the world and Southeast Asia is the epicenter of dengue mosquito breeding due to its tropical climate. In the Philippines, the disease outbreak has spread to more areas and impacted more lives. From 2014 to 2015, dengue fever cases rose significantly by 60 percent – from 121,000 to to 200,415. This year, the incidence rate shot even higher with cases escalating 33 percent in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year.\nHeather Pelier, General Manager of GSK Consumer Healthcare said: \"Dengue is rife in Philippines and unless we join forces, the disease will become the fastest spreading health threat in Philippines. GSK was motivated to initiate Allied Against Dengue as we were concerned with the escalating hazard and effects of dengue on the nation, including our employees and their families who have experienced the dreaded disease. Uniting forces and actions enable greater empowerment across stakeholders, education delivery to communities nationwide, and allow us to help people do more, feel better, and live longer. Allied Against Dengue is the catalyst to this with the ultimate goal to reduce the impact of dengue burden on Filipinos.\"\nThrough AAD, more than 1200 pediatricians and pharmacists will be involved in educating the publc and raising awareness of dengue fever management across the Philippines. This is aligned to and complements the DOH’s initiatives and the World Health Organization (WHO)'s global strategy for prevention and control of dengue.\nThe coalition strategy will include:\nDistribution of 50,000 DOH primers to at least 5 public schools in dengue hotspots in Metro Manila\nDistribution of 15,000 leaflets to 1,000 pediatricians and general practitioners\nEducation on proper dengue fever prevention and management with 20 health centers for barangay outreach programs\nImplementation of the Continuous Pharmacy Education (CPE) Program in identified chapters, targeting 200 pharmacists\nEducation and recruitment of at least 1000 AAD members through employee engagement, online, and on-ground activations\nTo achieve these milestones, AAD is set to roll out a series of initiatives including train-the-trainer programs, organized information centers through the coalition partners’ networks, community education activations, and employee volunteers who will be part of and drive the community outreach at dengue hot spots.\nFor more information on Allied Against Dengue and how to be an ally, contact GSK via landline at 1800-14441-0884m 1800-8908-8275, or through email via ph.customer-relations@gsk.com.

It arrived in the Philippines in February, and is set to be administered to over 1 million Filipino schoolchildren in 3 regions which recorded the highest number of dengue cases in recent years.\n\"The number one main recommendation is that this vaccine is efficacious and safe but should be only used in populations where the disease incidence in the population is at least 50%,\" John Abramson, chair of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), told a news conference in Geneva.\nWHO SAGE said that the dengue vaccine is not recommended for use in children under 9 years old, and should be given in 3 doses at a 6-month interval. It also recommended that each country define the target age for routine vaccination.\nOn April 4, the DOH began its school-based immunization, administering dengue vaccines to Grade 4 students in Regions III, IV-A, and the National Capital Region. As of April 17, a total of 148,431 students out of 206,673 students were vaccinated.\nThe DOH said the first dose of the vaccine will be given from April to June 2016, with the second dose slated from October to December 2016, and the last dose April to June 2017.\nThe Philippines is among countries in the Western Pacific region with the highest incidence of dengue in recent years.

At saka binasa ko sa kanilang papel mismo ng supplier, nakalagay dito 'pag may genetic defect 'wag isasali. Eh sinali,\" Gordon told reporters on Tuesday, December 6, after a Senate committee hearing on the Department of Health (DOH)'s school-based dengue immunization program.\n(This kid was vaccinated, he was not asked about his condition. And when I read the papers of the supplier, it was stated there not to include a person with a genetic defect. But they included him.)\nThe chair of the Senate blue ribbon committee was referring to John Paul Rafael, the 11-year-old who had a congenital heart disease. He died last April 11, just days after he was administered the dengue vaccine.\nThe DOH already said the cause of death was pulmonary edema (the abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs), with congenital heart disease and acute gastroenteritis with moderate dehydration as underlying causes.\nRafael's uncle and aunt – his guardians – were present during Tuesday's hearing to explain what happened to their nephew.\nManuel Ramirez said Rafael told him about the free dengue vaccine, but they missed the orientation for the immunization program. His wife Kristina, however, signed Rafael's consent form.\nAt the time of Rafael's vaccination, he had slight fever (sinat) and was still recovering from sickness. Ramirez accompanied the boy to school to get the first dose of the vaccine. He also told the teachers and those in charge that Rafael still had slight fever.\n\"Pinapasok siya sa room, pinagpahinga. Maya-maya, tinurukan na, pinagpahinga. Sumakit ulo, binigyan ng paracetamol (He was asked to enter the room, he rested for a while. Later on, he was vaccinated, then he rested. He got a headache and was given paracetamol),\" Ramirez recounted.\nThree days after immunization, the boy developed diarrhea and fever, and was taken to the Bagac Community & Medicare Hospital, where he was diagnosed with amoebiasis.\nHe was later admitted to the Isaac Catalina Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte imbalance. On April 10, he was transferred to the Bataan General Hospital, where he suffered cardiac arrest and died on April 11.\nHealth Secretary Paulyn Ubial, who was present during Tuesday's hearing, said it is \"incumbent\" for the health officer to check the condition of the patient before administering the vaccine.\nLack of training?\nBut former health secretary Janette Garin, who spearheaded the school-based dengue immunization, noted that when the National Adverse Event Following Immunization Committee (NAEFIC) convened, they concluded that Rafael's death is not related to the vaccine,\n\"We also asked the [World Health Organization] representatives present na kapag ba ang bata may congenital heart disease, do we stop vaccination? And the answer was no, because they are actually prone to infections,\" Garin explained.\n(We also asked the World Health Organization representatives present: do we stop vaccination if a child has congenital heart disease? And the answer was no, because they are actually prone to infections.)\nGordon still criticized the health workers' \"obvious\" lack of training, considering that they still administered the dengue vaccine despite Rafael's slight fever.\n\"Pumapasok ang gamot na bago, tama ba na ganun ang patakaran natin? Dapat baguhin natin. We're here in aid of lesiglation as well. We cannot prosecute you here, we can only recommend. All we're saying is, did we do the diligence, at the very least, of a good father or mother? They have the right to say, 'Puwede ba 'yan kahit may sakit ito?' Dapat ang gobyerno ang magsasabi 'Kung may sakit, 'wag na muna ho',\" he told the health department.\n(This new drug has just arrived, is it right for our policies to be like that? We're here in aid of legislation as well. We cannot prosecute you here, we can only recommend. All we're saying is, did we do the diligence, at the very least, of a good father or mother? They have the right to say, \"Can you still give this vaccine even if the child is sick?\" But the government should be the one to decide whether to defer giving the vaccine to a sick child.)\nUbial said there has been a number of patients who were actually deferred for dengue immunization because of illness.\n\"We want all the patients to be safe,\" she added.\n'Good program'\nDr Mary Ann Lansang, who was head of the infectious diseases section of the Department of Medicine at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, noted that chronic disease was actually one of the exclusion criteria during the vaccine's clinical trials conducted in the Philippines.\n\"They were practicing due diligence by not including chronic disease patients,\" Lansang said of the clinical trial conducted by Dr Maria Rosario Capeding of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.\nCapeding was part of the 3 phases of the clinical trials as the country's principal investigator. This clinical trial, according to Lansang, was one of the \"strongest basis\" for the registration of the dengue vaccine.\nIn an interview with reporters after the hearing, Ubial said she cannot judge the decisions of the previous administration.\n\"But as a program manager of the Expanded Program on Immunization before, kailangan talaga may due diligence and social preparation. 'Yun ang tingin ni Senator Gordon. For me, I raised that objection when I was assistant secretary,\" she explained.\n(But as a program manager of the Expanded Program on Immunization before, there really should be due diligence and social preparation. That's how Senator Gordon sees it. For me, I raised that objection when I was assistant secretary.)\nNow that Ubial is health secretary, she vowed to fix the system \"so that the vaccination program is preserved.\"\n\"It's a good program,\" she added.\nThe health department is already administering the second dose of the dengue vaccine to around 489,000 public school students (at least 9 years old) in Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and the National Capital Region.\nDengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito.

More than 40,000 patients were involved,\" said Dr Sally Gatchalian of the Philippine Pediatric Society.\nGarin was responding to reports that the vaccine was not safe, and that 4 participants in a clinical trial had died as a result of the vaccine.\nWhile Garin confirmed that 4 people died, she said that their deaths were completely unrelated to the vaccine. Three died due to a vehicular accident and one was a victim of homicide, the health chief said.\nGarin added that based on clinical trials, the incidence of systemic side effects – such as fever and pain and redness on the injection site – did not differ among those who were given the vaccine and those who were the placebo group.\nShe said that these side effects were considered normal.\nGarin underscored the importance of the dengue vaccine, which is set to be administered to Filipino schoolchildren in 3 regions next month.\nShe said that with immunization, hospitalization due to dengue will go down by 81%, while 93% of patients will have reduction in severity.\nDr Jaime Santos of the Philippine Children's Medical Center also said the dengue vaccine will greatly boost the country's anti-dengue efforts.\n\"Vaccination is a pillar of dengue control. Vaccination is a much-needed support to the dengue control program,\" he said.\nSchool-based immunization\nIn January, the health department said that more than one million Filipino schoolchildren in 3 regions with high incidence of dengue will be among the first recipients of the vaccine.\nThe DOH has allocated P3.5 billion from its savings to buy the vaccine, which will be given to 9-year-olds in the National Capital Region (NCR), Central Luzon, and Calabarzon beginning April.\nOf the total 200,415 dengue cases recorded in the country from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, 94,883 were recorded in these 3 regions: 25,208 from NCR, 35,966 from Central Luzon, and 33,709 from Calabarzon.\nDOH spokesperson Lyndon Lee Suy earlier said that the first dose of the vaccine will be given to students ahead of the rainy season, when the number of dengue cases is expected to increase.\nHe added that the school-based immunization will determine whether the procurement of the vaccine can be included in the DOH budget in the coming years.\nDengvaxia arrived in the Philippines last month, almost two months since its sale in the country was approved. The vaccine provides protection from all 4 dengue strains, and is recommended for all healthy individuals 9 years old to 45 years old, to be given in 3 doses at a 6-month interval.\nDengue is a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries, and is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito. According to the WHO, as many as 400 million people are infected with dengue worldwide every year.\nThe Philippines is one of 4 countries in the Western Pacific region which posted the highest incidence of dengue in recent years.\nIn 2013, the DOH reported 204,906 dengue cases – the highest number recorded since the establishment of the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program in 1993.\nThe number decreased slightly in 2014, but according to the health department, data from 2015 suggested an increasing trend in the coming years.\nWhile the DOH said the vaccine will be an \"additional strategy\" in the fight against dengue, it also noted that active measures such as cleaning one's surroundings remain better because these target other mosquito-borne diseases as well.",

Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects school-aged children aged 5 to 14 years old.\nAccording to Health Secretary Janette Garin, mosquitoes that transmit dengue are most active two hours after sunrise and two hours before sunset.\nThe department is set to provide 10,000 Insecticide-Treated Screens (ITS) rolls for 20,000 classrooms in the Philippines.\nPriority will be given to first floor classrooms located in areas where dengue cases are high, as well as provinces where the number of cases are still expected to rise.\nThe screen is proven and tested to have a safe level of insecticide (permethrin). Because of the chemical, it has a repellent effect that can last up to 5 years, even with exposure to climate and frequent washing.\nGarin said it can kill other insects, cockroaches, bees, and head lice. The screen is also used in areas endemic for malaria.\nThis intervention has been in place since 2009, with 7,620 schools already reached nationwide. This year, P71 million ($1.55 million) out of the P240-million ($5.22 million) total budget for DOH's dengue program has been allocated for the ITS.\nThe department intends to institutionalize this intervention nationwide.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines - Filipino scientists have recently developed a way to detect dengue faster than current tests can, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) announced this week.\nScientists at the University of the Philippines Manila (UPM) have developed a rapid test kit for dengue, called the Biotek-M, which promises a speedier -- and cheaper -- method to check if a patient has dengue.\nThe DOST said the new method, developed by experts from the Institute of Molecular Biology & Biotechnology-National Institutes of Health (IMBB-NIH), uses a variation of the usual Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, the isothermal PCR method.\nIn the locally-developed technique, nucleic acid is extracted from the blood, added to the test kit, and observed for a change in color after an hour. Green would mean the patient has dengue, while orange would indicate the patient is clear of it, according to the DOST.\nThe new test gives doctors, hospitals, and patients another option to detect dengue fever. The other tests currently available in the market are the PCR test, the serological test, and the antigen detection test.\nViral disease\nDengue, according to the World Health Organization, is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, and is a major global public health concern.\nAside from helping patients get faster diagnosis, the Biotek-M test will also be a big help to doctors and hospitals because it will lower costs of tests, lessen hospital admissions of patients awaiting test results, and assist doctors in making better decisions.\nThe clinical validation of the research is in process, as part of regulatory compliance before the commercial release of the test kit, according to Dr Raul Destura, project lead and IMBB-NIH head.\nAt present, field tests are being done at the Rizal Medical Center, the National Children's Hospital, and the Philippine Children's Medical Center. Results, according to Destura are \"promising.\"\nThe development of Biotek-M was funded by the DOST's Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD), part of the agency's anti-dengue program.",

The same students will then get the second and third doses at 6-month intervals – on October to December 2016 and April to June 2017, respectively.\nDengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito. Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children.\nThe Philippines is among countries in the Western Pacific region with the highest incidence of dengue in recent years. As of February 20, a total of 18,790 suspected dengue cases were reported nationwide – 13.2% higher compared to the same period in 2015.\n'Unusual'\nBut health advocates on Monday raised alarm over what they call a \"rushed\" implementation of the program. (READ: DOH: Vaccine an 'additional strategy' to fight dengue in PH)\nDr Anthony Leachon, independent director of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and a representative of the Monetary Board, said it is \"unusual\" for the mass vaccination to immediately follow the vaccine's regulatory approval.\nHe also asked why the DOH could not wait two more weeks for the recommendation of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Dengvaxia.\nLeachon, who has 20 years of experience in pharmaceutical medicine, said the usual practice is for the Philippines to wait first for other countries like the United States and Europe, since these countries have \"rigid monitoring.\"\nBesides, he said, if the department waits one more year, the final results of the study will give definite information on the dengue vaccine. Waiting for 3 more years for WHO prequalification, he said, will increase the vaccine's affordability.\nLeachon also raised concerns on how cost-effective the vaccine is.\n\"Medyo nabahala ako ng kaunti kasi P3.5 billion po ito…. Alam niyo po ba na ang immunization natin sa 7 na gamot ay nagkakahalaga po ng P3 billion, [for diseases such as] measles, mumps, rubella, pneumonia. Ang performance natin 60%. Gagastos ka ng P3.5 billion sa isang sakit na dengue, samantalang 'yung expanded [program on] immunization na ginawa since 1970s ay hindi natin perpekto.\"\n(I'm a little concerned about the P3.5 billion.... Did you know our immunization on 7 medicines amount to P3 billion, for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, pneumonia. Our performance is 60%. You will spend P3.5 billion for one disease, that is, dengue, when we have yet to perfect our expanded program on immunization established in the 1970s.)\nChances of severe dengue?\nLeachon, president of the Philippine College of Physicians Foundation, joins Dr Antonio Dans, who has been vocal against the department for pushing through with the program even without WHO recommendations and prequalification.\nDans, president of the Philippine Society of General Internal Medicine and professor at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine, earlier expressed his worry over \"antibody dependent enhancement\" – a phenomenon wherein the vaccine might lower the number of dengue cases initially, but could later increase the severity of the disease.\nHe said severe illness could have a long-term effect on a child's physical and mental health.\nDans said he may not be a vaccine expert, but he is a clinical epidemiologist who can analyze results of trials.\nHe believes the vaccine's safety is not proven because studies on it are stil ongoing. He also pointed out that DOH established intensified surveillance to monitor adverse side effects, and even asked the students to get their parents' informed consent.\n\"Kami kampi sa dengue vaccine. Sana manalo ang dengue vaccine. Sino bang kokontra noon? Pero bakit natin sasabihing mananalo tayo kung nasa 1st half pa lang tayo?\" Dans said, likening study on the vaccine to a basketball game.\n(We side with the dengue vaccine. We hope the dengue vaccine works. Who will oppose that? But how can we say we have already won when we're just in the 1st half?)\nBased on his own analysis, he said he is \"97% sure\" the WHO will recommend the need to study the dengue vaccine longer.\nIf the dengue vaccine does not turn out to be as safe and effective as promised, Leachon and Dans are both worried Filipinos will lose their trust in the government's entire expanded program on immunization.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) will expand its school-based dengue immunization program to include public school students in Central Visayas.\nThis was revealed by health officials on Tuesday, October 4, during the plenary deliberations on the 2017 budget in the House of Representatives.\nThe DOH's proposed budget was sponsored at the plenary by Masbate 3rd District Representative Scott Davies Lanete.\nA couple of lawmakers on Tuesday asked the department if the vaccination will continue as scheduled this month.\nAround 489,000 Grade 4 students (at least 9 years old) in Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and the National Capital Region are set to receive their second dose of the dengue vaccine from October to December 2016.\nLanete, who was in consultation with DOH officials during the plenary deliberations, said students in Central Visayas will also get their first dose of the vaccine this month.\n\"This dengue vaccine is relatively new to the market, so it has just passed Phase III clinical trials. And since it is undergoing pilot implementation in Regions III, IV-A, and NCR, it is now undergoing Phase 4 clinical trial,\" he explained to Albay 1st District Representative Edcel Lagman.\nLanete continued: \"The department has already also issued a resolution dated October 3, that since the seroprevalence of Region VII is more than 70% or way above the recommendation, it will expand the program to Region VII as well.\"\n\"However since it's still in clinical trial, it would be prudent for the department to study the program after 5 years, so in answer to your query, it will expand and continue program to pilot areas which the department has identified, however it holds itself after 5 years before implementing the program nationwide.\"\nLanete told Lagman that the October 3 resolution has been signed by all members of the expert panel and approved by Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial.\nFlip-flop?\nMeanwhile, during his interpellation, Kabayan Representative Harry Roque Jr called out Ubial's supposed \"flip-flopping\" on the school-based dengue immunization program.\n\"My apprehension is, this…resolution...came at a time when there was apparently a previous action on the part of the secretary of the Department of Health to discontinue this program. My concern is the apparent flip-flop of the secretary of health as far as the dengue program is concerned. Will [you] admit this program was suspended? And I believe the suspension was on July 20, 2016,\" Roque said.\nLanete answered: \"The department, as well as the secretary, assures it will continue the program most especially in pilot areas and review within the 5-year clinical trial phase for continuation of program within the entire nation.\"\nRoque than asked if reports are true that when the program was cancelled, P500-million worth of dengue vaccines were recalled form DOH health centers and brought to the department's warehouses.\n\"The remaining vaccines are left within health centers and were not brought to a central facility within the DOH, but the department assures these are stored in appropriate containers and warehouses where they will last as long as their expiry,\" Lanete said, adding that the vaccination initially targeted a population of 750,000 children.\nHe even enumerated a number of reasons why only around 489,000 students were immunized.\n\"One reason is they could be absent. Another reason is they could be sick, they have fever, flu. Another reason is they may be pregnant…Among others, these are part of reasons why there is a gap between the targeted population and the number of doses given, apart from that fact it was also administered during summer break, wherein many students were having graduation, absent, or some parents didn't sign parental consent for these individuals.\"\nBut on Tuesday, Roque repeatedly expressed his concern about the health department's denial that the program was suspended.\n\"I understand the predicament of the sponsor. It was not he, after all, who caused the suspension of this program,\" Roque said, referring to Lanete.\nHe continued: \"But for the record, we have had committee deliberations on the budget of the DOH. It was no less than our deputy speaker from Cebu who brought the issue of the dengue vaccination, and it was very clear as the transcripts will in fact show that it was the position of the secretary of health that that dengue vaccination was suspended.\"\n\"I am bewildered now why the same secretary of health is saying it was never suspended.\"\nProbe vaccine, lawmakers urged\nHealth advocates on Monday, October 3, appealed to lawmakers to continue investigating the safety and efficacy of the dengue vaccine.\n\"There is significant doubt in the scientific community about the safety of the dengue vaccine in question,\" said Dr Antonio Dans, professor at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine and president of the Asia-Pacific Center for Evidence-Based Medicine.\n\"A trial that included Filipinos showed that the incidence of severe dengue increased up to 5 times more, 3 years after children were vaccinated,\" he added.\nDans has been vocal against the department for pushing through with the program\n\"Evidence matters, but making hasty health policy decisions on incomplete data puts our children at risk. The fact is, the company, Sanofi, is marketing this drug despite doubts of safety. The continuing vaccine trial is the strongest evidence that the dengue immunization program is premature, and that even the company has some doubt,\" he said in a statement.\nDengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito. Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children.\nThe Philippines is among countries in the Western Pacific region with the highest incidence of dengue in recent years.",

We should be sure about this),\" Gordon said.\n\"Palabas na yung administrasyon, biglang naglabas ng ganoong perang kalaki, P4 na bilyon (The last administration was already on its way out, and then it came out with this much money, P4 billion),\" he added, referring to the budget used to procure the vaccines.\nDuring the hearing, Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial clarified that this was not part of DOH's 2015 budget, but it was allocated by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).\n\"[Ito'y] dumaan sa proseso ayon sa procedures ng DBM…. Ito'y dumaan sa government procedures sapagkat 'di naman kami hahayaan bumili ng bakuna kung ito'y sasalungat sa mga procedures na acceptable at legal sa ating pamahalaan,\" Health Spokesperson Eric Tayag told reporters after the hearing.\n(This went through a process based on DBM procedures.... This went through government procedures because we will not be allowed to procure vaccines if this goes against procedures that are deemed acceptable and legal by the government.)\nDOH 'open to discussion'\nLast October 4, the health department told lawmakers at the House of Representatives that the program will be expanded to include public school students in Central Visayas.\nOn Tuesday, however, Tayag said Ubial is still seeking the recommendation of an expert panel on the matter.\n\"Sinisiguro na [ang] karanasan ukol dito, kasama [ang] pagsusuri, maire-report ng maayos, so ngayon po hinihintay namin habilin ng expert panel (We're making sure that we will report clearly our experience and research on this, so now we're still awaiting the recommendation of the expert panel),\" he told reporters.\nAsked if the program was rushed, Tayag answered: \"Lumalabas nga na parang mabilis, pero sinusunod ng Kagawaran ng Kalusugan ang mga alituntunin at rekomendaysong naibigay ng World Health Organization bago gamitin ang bakuna.\"\n(It may appear that this program was rushed, but the Department of Health followed the rules and recommendations of the World Heath Organization before using this vaccine.)\nAnd while they don't see any irregularities in the program's implementation, he said DOH is open to any discussion because they want to remain transparent.\nDuring the hearing, Ubial said it is the expert panel's recommendation to review the results of the school-based dengue immunization program in the 3 pilot areas before considering its nationwide implementation.\nDengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito.

There's something fishy here. We should begin the investigation [or] inquiry at the presence of the person involved with this inquiry,\" SAGIP Representative Rodante Marcoleta said less than 10 minutes after the resource persons were recognized.\nGarin was scheduled to appear in the November 29 hearing, but was eventually recognized on Monday.\nQuezon 4th District Representative Angelina Tan moved to defer the proceedings and to reschedule it to November 29. Tan deemed it better to move the hearing since \"mahirap mag-usap (it's difficult to talk)\" when emotions were already running high.\n\"The members have some questions on the procedure of inviting guests, and I thought okay na kasi (it was already okay) we allowed the former secretary to sit,\" she told reporters after her motion was approved and the committee hearing was adjourned.\nMarcoleta also wanted the resource persons to secure approval from the organizations they represent before speaking about the dengue vaccine at the hearing.\nStrategy\nTan, chair of the House committee on health, explained that her decision to invite Garin on the November 29 hearing was a strategic move on her part.\n\"As the chair of the committee, you strategize sinong unang dapat pakinggan…. Ako as chair, gusto kong marinig 'yung mga tao sa baba involved in, first is, approval of the FDA [Food and Drug Administration], so very important 'yung formulary evaluation committee.\"\n(As the chair of the committee, you strategize who you should listen to first.

Seven others followed suit, including Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Peru and the Philippines.\nSanofi is awaiting authorizations in 18 other countries.\nThe fast-growing disease infects as many as 400 million people every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which has endorsed the vaccine.\nSanofi's research and development work took 20 years, costing more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion).\nNow, Sanofi and other pharmaceutical firms are racing to find a weapon against Zika, which like dengue is carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.\n\"Developing a vaccine against Zika will be easier after developing a vaccine against dengue,\" Leroy said, noting that the viruses share genetic similarities.\n\"All these investments (on dengue) through more than 100 collaborations worldwide allow us today to gain a lot of time on different vaccinal approaches\" against Zika, he said.\nSome 70 countries and territories have reported local mosquito-borne Zika transmission, with Brazil by far the hardest hit and the WHO declaring it a public health emergency.\nZika causes only mild symptoms for most people such as fever and a rash, but infected pregnant women can give birth to babies with microcephaly, a deformation marked by abnormally small brains and heads.\nVaccine concerns\nScientists had also long been stumped by dengue, which has 4 separate strains, forcing researchers to find a drug able to fight all of them at once.\nDengue can trigger a crippling fever, along with muscle and joint pain.\nBut clinical tests on 40,000 people from 15 countries found Dengvaxia can immunize two thirds of people aged 9 years and older, rising to 93% for the more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever.\nIt was also found to reduce the risk of hospitalization by 80%.\nBrazil launched a public immunization program for 500,000 people in Parana in August, while the Philippines has injected 489,000 public school children aged 9 since it became in April the first country to use the vaccine.\nPhilippines health department spokesman Eric Tayag said authorities followed WHO recommendations, which say it should not be given to children under 9 years old.\n\"We are tracking each child\" to look for any sign of dengue or side effects, Tayag said.\nSome scientists have voiced concerns about studies showing that the vaccine could give dengue to people who have never had the virus.\nScott Halstead, founder of the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative, told AFP that the WHO was \"being hasty\" in recommending the vaccine and that people should be tested to see if they have had dengue before being vaccinated.\n\"It's not ethical to give a vaccine that harms someone,\" Halstead said.\nBut Leroy noted that Dengvaxia, in addition to the WHO's green light, is getting approval from government health regulators.\n\"It is a great solution and the first solution because dengue did not have until now any specific medial solution to treat this illness,\" Leroy said, adding that Sanofi is conducting studies in Asia among younger people to see if the vaccine's reach can expand.",

But the DOH will begin its school-based immunization this April.\nThis means even without recommendations from the WHO, the health department will start giving the vaccine to more than one million 9-year-old students in the National Capital Region, Central Luzon, and Calabarzon.\n\"It does not mean that we are saying countries should not go ahead,\" Weiler said, clarifying recent reports that highlighted the UN agency has not yet completed its review of the vaccine.\nWeiler added: \"It is the prerogative of countries to license the product and to determine the use of the product based on an internal scientific appraisal of the clinical research that is underpinning the product.\"\nHe also stressed that countries are autonomous and will use products as they deem. \"We're not in a position to give a go- or not go-signal,” he said when asked if the WHO is giving the vaccine a go-signal even without the recommendations.\nThe Philippines is one of the countries where clinical tests of Dengvaxia were conducted. It also became the first Asian country to approve the sale of the dengue vaccine in December 2015. The first batch of doses arrived in the Philippines in February.\nDengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito. Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children.\nAccording to the WHO, as many as 400 million people are infected with dengue worldwide every year, two-thirds of which are in Asia.\nGarin: We're prepared for vaccine\nDr Maria Rosario Capeding of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine assured the public that the dengue vaccine is safe.\n\"Philippines has been in the forefront in terms of the development of this dengue vaccine.... I'm confident so far with the results that we have from the efficacy trials,\" said Capeding, who was part of the 3 phases of the clinical trials as the country's principal investigator.\nHealth Secretary Janette Garin also noted that aside from the Philippines, 3 other countries have already approved the vaccine: Mexico, Brazil, and El Salvador.\n\"If this is not safe, do you think [these] countries will gamble the health of their children?\"\nGarin also dismissed criticisms that the health department is rushing the implementation of the program.\n\"Recommendations will exist to guide countries. It does not follow that we have to adopt all of them,\" she explained.\n\"We're not rushing the implementation of this dengue vaccination. It's a program that will run from March up to 20 months or longer….We're implementing because we're already prepared,\" Garin added in a mix of English and Filipino.\nShe said her department will welcome healthy competition should there be another dengue vaccine in the next 4 to 5 years. But for now, they won't let more children die due to dengue when a safe dengue vaccine is already available in the country.\nHealth Spokesperson Lyndon Lee Suy, meanwhile, said a vaccine's prequalification is not a condition for a product to be used in the country.\nAssistance from WHO\nAs the WHO waits for the final recommendation of the SAGE, Weiler has already offered to assist the Philippines in terms of technical advice, which involves monitoring and surveillance of possible side effects, as well as review of the health department's protocols.\n\"The mere fact that they [WHO] are with us in the implementation – that speaks a thousand words,\" Garin said in a mix of English and Filipino.\nAhead of the official launch of the school-based immunization program in April, the DOH already started immunizing thousands of public school students from Central Luzon. Of more than 4,000 immunized students, only 5 developed fever.\nThe Philippines is among countries in the Western Pacific region with the highest incidence of dengue in recent years. (READ: DOH: Vaccine an 'additional strategy' to fight dengue in PH)\nAs of February 20, a total of 18,790 suspected dengue cases were reported nationwide – 13.2% higher compared to the same period in 2015.\nThe DOH has allocated P3.5 billion ($76.09 million) from its savings to buy the dengue vaccine. This is bigger than the P887.18 million ($19.29 million) allocated by the health department in 2015 for all neglected tropical diseases, including dengue.",

In the morning, blood came out of his nose. It happened so fast,\" said Phoebe Ambanloc, a dental secretary from San Carlos City in Pangasinan.\nAmbanloc recalled the dreadful experience of watching his 22-year-old brother Fabian fall sick to dengue in September. Before getting sick, Fabian had spent a week taking care of their 8-year-old sister, Letecia, who was hospitalized because of dengue as well.\n\"It was traumatic to have two family members fall sick one after the other. We cleared plant pots and put mosquito nets up after that,\" Ambanloc said. (READ: DOH identifies 80 barangays as dengue 'hot zones')\nThe case of the Ambanloc siblings is not isolated as more Filipino children face the dangers of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and Chikungunya – a mosquito-borne disease that shares clinical symptoms with dengue, but is incurable.\nRecords from the Department of Health (DOH) show there were 76,391 people who had been infected with the dengue virus from January to September in 2017. (READ: Fast facts about dengue in PH)\nWhile this is 45.4% lower compared to the same period last year, alarmingly, majority of the cases (22.5%) had been children from 5 to 9 years old. This age group also recorded the highest fatality.\nA total of 1,530 Chikungunya cases were recorded from January to September 2017, with most patients belonging to the 25 to 29 years age group. There were 3 deaths reported. (READ: DOH warns vs mosquito bites after 9 deaths from Japanese encephalitis)\nChildren's health endangered\nDr Anthony Calibo, officer-in-charge of the Children’s Health Division at the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau at the Department of Health (DOH), said that forest destruction which disturbs the habitat of certain disease carrying insects has led to increase in spreading the disease.\n\"With forest destruction resulting to or being part of climate change, mosquitoes for example will try to fly to other areas when their known habitat has been destroyed. As such, Aedes mosquitoes, the vector of dengue and chikungunya, seek refuge in domesticated settings,\" he explained.\nIn a lecture, Jonathan Lambert of Cornell University's Institute for Climate Smart Solutions said that mosquitoes migrating to new habitats is part of climate-induced changes in vector behavior and ecology. (READ: Climate change: Why PH should care)\nWith thinner forest cover, there is lesser defense against global warming. A warmer environment alters breeding periods for species such as mosquitoes, causing them to mature faster and become active disease carriers sooner, he explained.\nLambert also cited that the El Niño weather event, which is characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures, has increased malaria risks 5-fold.\n\"There’s also been an increase in water-borne disease outbreaks that occur after extreme precipitations which are occurring due to climate change,\" he said. This has a disproportionate effect on communities, putting the elderly and the very young at greater risk, he added.\nMalnourished children\nAside from being at risk of infection from vector-borne diseases, Filipino children are also most vulnerable to diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection including pneumonia, and measles when disasters displace their families and disrupt their lives.\nSeeking shelter in crowded evacuation centers that have poorly hygienic conditions make children more susceptible to diseases, Calibo said. (READ: On nutrition and disasters)\n\"Malnutrition can also happen because of disruption of routine practices at home involving feeding of infants and young children. Other climate disturbances as drought, extreme heat can also affect food security leading to malnutrition,\" he added.\nThe National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC) acknowledges the need to improve evacuation facilities.\nKarla Minorka Aldea, communications staff of the NDRRMC, said they have started installing more toilets and bathing facilities in evacuation areas. \"There are also interventions for nutrition such as vitamin supplication and supplementary feeding,\" she added.\nMore costs\nMany health impacts from climate change can be prevented through early action, significantly lowering the costs as opposed to dealing with impacts after they occur, Cornell University’s Lambert argued.\n\"Climate action is much more beneficial to our over-all economy than climate inaction,\" he urged.\nCalibo said that geohazard mapping should integrate both climate and geologic risks with the other aspects of child health, including access to health care facilities, food production and security, and road and transport network availability. \"This way, risks mitigation and disaster preparedness will be achieved,\" he said.\nCalibo said that as a means to build resilience amid climate change-related health risks among children, the DOH is mapping its strategies towards Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 development goals internationally adopted in 2015 that seeks to end poverty, hunger, and lack of access to quality healthcare and education by 2030. SDG 3 addresses equal access to healthcare.\nThe First 1000 Days campaign, for example, links many public health interventions to SDG 3 and also SDG 2, he said, with programs that aim to reduce newborn, infant and under-5 child deaths and child malnutrition. (READ: Global Goals)\n\"If health is at the center of all policies and strategies, the welfare of children will always be assured,\" Calibo said.\nAccording to a 2015 UNICEF report, more than half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flooding occurrence and 160 million live in drought zones, therefore exposing them to the dangers of climate change.\n\"All interventions that will reduce impact of climate change on children will ultimately be dependent on efforts and initiatives by the adult members of the community, the decision and policy makers and implementors,\" Calibo said.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) on Thursday, June 20, launched a website which will show crowdsourced dengue-related information from public schools nationwide.\nThe Dengue Vector Surveillance website carries information on mosquito population nationwide, as well as dengue incidence and other mosquito-related facts.\nThe website is part of a program called Nationwide Dengue Vector Surveillance, an inter-agency cooperation strategy for intensifying the government's anti-dengue drive.\nDengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children.\nThe program began after a 2011 Memorandum of Agreement among government agencies led by the DOST, Department of Education (DepEd), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Department of Health (DOH).\nPractical and simple\nThe first component of the Nationwide Dengue Vector Surveillance program is the deployment, installation and monitoring of the Ovicidal-Larvicidal (OL) traps in public elementary and high schools nationwide.\nDOST Secretary Mario Montejo said the agencies chose to launch the program in schools because they are the most vulnerable places for diseases such as dengue.\n\"There are many children, and most of them are in school during daytime. Dengue-carrying mosquitoes are usually present at daytime,\" he said in Filipino, adding that children are also prone to heavy perspiration which attracts mosquitoes.\nThe manufacturer of the OL trap, Heritage Veterinary Corp, is tasked to produce and deliver the kits to schools. The distribution started last June 13.\nThe kit is composed of 3 elements: a black container, a lawanit paddle where mosquitoes lay their eggs, and a pack of pellets used to make a solution that kills the eggs and larvae of mosquitoes. The solution made from one pack of pellet is good for one week.\nThe \"attack and trap\" OL kit is DOST’s \"practical and simple technology\" in reducing dengue cases in schools.\nNo to defogging\nIn the past, defogging was a common but temporary solution to alarming cases of dengue in the country. However, DepEd Health and Nutrition Center Director Dr. Ella Naliponguit said they do not recommend it.\n\"We don't recommend defogging because it really doesn't help. The mosquitoes are only displaced,\" she said in Filipino, adding that DepEd only allows defogging when there is an outbreak in school.\nReporting process\nThe second component of the Nationwide Dengue Vector Surveillance program is the establishment of a website for dengue vector surveillance.\nAll information on the Dengue Vector Surveillance website will come from school coordinators.\nEach classroom adviser will have two OL trap kits in the classroom. They will report weekly to the school coordinator tasked to send raw data via text messaging.\nSchool coordinators must register their cellular phones first to be able to submit data:\nFOLLOW<space>LAMOK<space>SCHOOL ID and send to 2948\nAfter registration, their report must follow this format:\nPOST<space>LAMOK<space>no. of positive traps<space>no. of negative traps<space>no. of lost traps<space>date harvested and send to 2948\nThe report will be received by telecom Mega Mobile, which will forward the data to the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI)/Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) for data computation.\nThe website, developed by PCHRD, inherited the basic functionalities of Google Map. When a school shows a red balloon, it means the campus has a high dengue alert. A white balloon indicates otherwise.\nPublic schools first\nNaliponguit said that OL traps will be distributed first to public schools in Metro Manila, Cebu and Davao. They hope to cover the rest of the schools nationwide within the next 2-3 years.\nThe DOH is in charge of funding the kit. They allocated P84 million for the project, and initially released P30 million this month.\nThe first fund release from DOH will cover supplies for up to 3 months of implementation. Naliponguit said they will coordinate with different government and non-government organizations in sustaining the program.\nPrivate schools, on the other hand, may opt to buy the kits from several drug stores with a suggested retail price of P25/pack of pellet.\nDOST reminded everyone that the OL trap is not the solution to the problems caused by dengue. The kit is just one of many ways to reduce the alarming number of dengue-related deaths in the country.\nLast year, the DOH recorded a total of 294 deaths from dengue, a rise from the 259 death toll in 2011.",

    "timestamp": "June 26, 2013 4:22 PM",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines - The word “dengue” strikes fear in the hearts of many, and with good reason: for some patients, the viral infection can be deadly.\nSevere dengue affects most Asian and Latin American countries. It has put many children in these regions in hospitals or caused their deaths. There is no cure for dengue, no vaccine for this widespread disease.\nGlobally, dengue racked up 390 million infections last year, estimate Samir Bhatt, DPhil, and colleagues in a recent study published in the journal \"Nature.\" This infection total is more than 3 times the dengue burden estimate of the World Health Organization.\nTo spread the dengue virus, you need two things: first, people who are sick with dengue; second, female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to bite people infected with dengue and pass the virus on to other humans.\nTo control the spread of dengue, therefore, one must stop the virus from being transmitted between humans and insects. How? You can persuade people to wear insect repellant or to empty all containers in their homes that collect water where mosquitoes can breed. You can also use insecticides, but it would be costly.\nEnter Prof. Scott O’Neill and his colleagues at the Eliminate Dengue research program. They are testing an innovative approach to control the spread of disease, after having discovered that Wolbachia bacteria inoculated to a mosquito prevents the dengue virus.\n\"We found that if Wolbachia were present in the mosquito, the dengue virus couldn’t grow,\" O’Neill addressed in a recent forum in Manila. \"If the dengue virus couldn’t grow in the mosquito, it can’t be transmitted by the mosquito.\"\nThe research program was conducted in Monash University in Australia. Field trials began two years ago in the Cairns region.\nIn a nutshell, they reared mosquitoes that contain Wolbachia in the lab and released them into the site once a week. There, the mosquitoes mated with wild mosquitoes. The team then trapped these mosquitoes and took them back to the lab to determine if they had Wolbachia.\nThe trials were a success. \"We’ve shown that when we take those mosquitoes from the field, they had Wolbachia and could no longer transmit dengue,\" said O’Neill.\nThe trials also showed that the dengue-blocking strain of Wolbachia can easily be deployed and at very little cost. After 10 weeks of releases, the frequency of the strain was high; it continued to be higher than 95% even after releases stopped. Two years after, it stayed higher than 95% even without any additional mosquito releases.\nThe trials paved the way for similar tests in Brazil, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam. O’Neill cited the following key findings:\nThe technology is acceptable to the community and to regulators\nIt can be easily deployed at low cost. Once established, it can be sustained.\nLab assays showed that mosquitoes containing Wolbachia that were taken from the field have reduced capability to transmit dengue\nMathematical modeling suggests the method \"may significantly reduce and even…eliminate dengue in certain epidemiological contexts,\" O’Neill said. \"The likely impact of the intervention could be very large; we might see a reduction in dengue transmission in the order of 50% or greater.\"\nHe also cited the advantages of the Wolbachia method:\n1. It is natural and safe for people and the environment\nWolbachia only lives inside insect cells. It occurs naturally in up to 70% of all insect species, including mosquito species that bite people but do not transmit dengue. Wolbachia is not infectious; it cannot be transmitted to any mammals, including humans.\nRegulatory bodies in Australia, the US and Vietnam have approved the Wolbachia method. \"Our approach is a form of biological control that we hope will reduce our reliance on insecticide use,\" said O’Neill. \"The method should be particularly effective at dengue control in large urban areas of the developing world where conventional dengue control with insecticide is expensive.\"\n2. It requires very little resource after it has been put in place\n\"You do this work only once; you don’t have to keep on releasing mosquitoes,\" he said. As a result, you avoid \"donor fatigue\" or the inability to sustain resources in a program over a long period of time.\n3. It doesn’t require that people change their behaviors for the method to succeed\nGetting people to take new steps — such as destroying breeding sites — can be difficult.\n4. It complements other interventions\nO’Neill and his colleagues are confident that their approach would be fully compatible with a vaccine for dengue fever once it is developed.\nSo, does the Wolbachia method curb the incidence of dengue? That remains to be seen. \"Since dengue does not occur every year in the Cairns region and when it does it doesn’t always occur in the same place, the trials were not designed to directly measure reductions in dengue disease,\" said O’Neill.\nThe method by itself may not eliminate dengue, yet O’Neill and his team hope it may be a tool that will contribute to that end. \"Our big goal is to introduce Wolbachia into global Aedes aegypti populations. If we’re able to do that, I think we have the potential to have a significant impact on 390 million people, and on the annual incidence of dengue.\"",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – When a San Lazaro Hospital study on anti-dengue treatment ActRx TriAct was found to be \"scientifically valid,\" it became the basis for Health Secretary Enrique Ona's department order allowing more clinical trials of the drug in select government hospitals.\nBut more than a month after the order was stopped by Acting Secretary Janette Garin, medical groups criticized the study as \"poorly designed,\" with a data analysis that is \"seriously flawed.\"\nIn a statement Tuesday, December 16, the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP) and the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) refuted claims by proponents of the drug.\nThey did not name ActRx TriAct – a herbal-based combination of Artesunate, Berberine, and Artemether – and only referred to it as a \"novel triple-drug combination for dengue fever.\"\n\"The only basis for expanding the use of this drug combination to several DOH hospitals was a study on 290 dengue patients in one medical center. They claimed there were no deaths due to dengue among 145 patients who received this treatment in the clinical trial,\" said Dr Mario Panaligan, PSMID vice president and a member of the PCP Board of Regents.\n\"However, they are not saying in public that those who did not get this treatment also survived, which does not provide extra benefit in preventing deaths,\" Panaligan added.\nThe San Lazaro Hospital study supposedly claimed ActRx TriAct can eliminate the dengue virus faster, but PCP and PSMID said the study did not use the most accurate diagnostic test available to detect the virus in the blood of the patients.\nThe study was the basis for Ona's September 24 order allowing clinical trials of 2,000 units of ActRx TriAct for dengue treatment in 6 government hospitals. Garin suspended the order on November 14 to further evaluate whether the study complies with “established scientific and ethical standards.”\nOna is on extended leave, awaiting President Benigno Aquino III's assessment of his performance. He was asked to go on leave in October following a probe by the National Bureau of Investigation into complaints his department did not purchase \"more cost-effective\" vaccines for pneumonia. (READ: Aquino wants more answers from Ona)\nMalaria resistance\nTo date, there is no specific treatment for dengue in the Philippines, where the disease has become an epidemic. In 2013, the Department of Health (DOH) recorded 204,906 dengue cases and 660 deaths.\nActRx TriAct was called a breakthrough drug that can kill viruses, bacteria, and parasites like malaria. But PCP and PSMID are curious why researchers are leaving out other effects of the drug, like malaria resistance. (READ: The dangers of ActRx TriAct, according to DOH)\n\"In the case of the malaria parasite, only artemether and artesunate have been unequivocally proven to be effective, while berberine has not,\" said former PSMID president Rontgene Solante.\n\"The proponents of this research are not telling the public that unwarranted and widespread use of artemether and artesunate in the community will promote malaria resistance to the drug – a serious public health problem that the government should address immediately.\"\nThe World Health Organization had earlier warned that if ActRx Triact is used in areas where both malaria and dengue are coendemic – such as the Philippines – resistance to malaria could develop.\n'Stop use of unproven treatments'\nPCP and PSMID also dubbed the researchers as unethical for using the treatment on children without first testing it on adults. (READ: Is the anti-dengue drug trial ordered by Ona ethical?)\n\"It is our obligation to stop the expanded use of scientifically unproven treatments,\" the groups said in response to the claim that stopping Ona’s order deprives dengue patients of a \"promising\" drug. (READ: Anti-dengue drug trial 'beneficial' – Ona adviser)\nThe health department itself criticized the study for not complying with “the basic steps of a sound scientific research using people as subjects.” It also said all clinical trials involving the drug have no legal basis, as they were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\"We call on our colleagues to conduct clinical trials in accordance with the ethical principles consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the applicable regulatory requirements,\" said Dr Francisco Tranquilino, chair of PCP's ethics committee. \nBoth medical groups recommended the publication of the full trial report \"for public scrutiny,\" or for the report to be shared with \"all parties concerned.\"",

People of all ages can get tetanus, but it can be prevented through immunization.\nGarin said giving TD and MRTD vaccines to students is crucial, especially in a disaster-prone country like the Philippines.\n\"'Di ba kapag may calamities – may earthquake, may bagyo – magtatakbuhan 'yung mga pasyente 'pag nasugatan para mag-inject ng anti-tetanus, [but] in fact you can actually prepare for it,\" she said.\n(During calamities – earthquakes or typhoons – wounded patients run to hospitals to get anti-tetanus shots, but in fact you can actually prepare for it.)\nOn top of the 3 doses of tetanus vaccine given during the first year of life, the booster shots to be given as children reach grades 1 and 7 \"will give...lifetime immunity during calamities.\"\n\"Magpapadagdag ka lang, pero 'di ka na tatakbo, [‘di na] hahabulin yung 24 hours because you are already protected,” she added.\n(You can just get an additional shot, but you don't have to rush to the hospital 24 hours after getting wounded because you are already protected.)\nBut DOH's anti-tetanus program is one dose short compared to the WHO's prescription for a lifetime protection against the disease, which includes:\n3 doses of diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine in infancy\nTetanus-toxoid (TT)-containing booster at school-entry age (4 to 7 years old)\nTT-containing booster in adolescence (12 to 15 years old)\nTT-containing booster in early adulthood\nTetanus is one of the vaccine-preventable diseases included in DOH’s Expanded Program on Immunization.\nThe school-based immunization program that will begin in August will also include giving human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine to 300,000 female, grade 4 students in the 20 poorest provinces in the country.",

    "content": "PARIS, France – Scientists said Monday, November 10, they had found a variant of a gene that confers a near five-fold protection against typhoid fever, which affects millions of people each year.\nThe discovery, that came from screening the genomes of hundreds of infected people and healthy controls in Vietnam and Nepal, may aid the development of better vaccines for typhoid and other bacterial diseases, said the authors of a study published in Nature Genetics.\n\"We found that carrying a particular form of the HLA-DRB1 gene provides natural resistance against typhoid fever,\" study co-author Sarah Dunstan of the University of Melbourne said in a statement.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 21 million people are infected with typhoid fever every year, and an estimated 216,000 to 600,000 die.\nIt is caused by the Salmonella typhi or Paratyphi bacteria carried in contaminated food or water, said the study authors.\nThe gene they found protects against infection by recognizing proteins from invading bacteria, thus stimulating an immune response.\nVaccines against S. typhi do exist, but are not always effective and are not suitable for young children – the group most at risk, according to the study authors.\n\"Consequently, these vaccines are not widely deployed in the populations with the greatest need,\" they wrote.\n\"Notably, there is currently no licensed vaccine against enteric fever caused by S. Paratyphi pathovars, potentially constituting a huge problem as the incidence of S. Paratyphi A infection is increasing in many countries across Asia.\"\nThe team said their discovery may lead to \"improvements in the rational design of vaccines\" for this and other bacterial infections.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – Among the government agencies that saw significant budget increases in recent years is the Department of Health, thanks to revenues resulting from increased excise taxes.\nThe sin tax law is just one of the many landmark health legislations enacted under the Aquino administration.\nThere's the controversial reproductive health law in 2012, the graphic health warning law in 2014, and the amendment of the Expanded Senior Citizens Act to provide health insurance to all senior citizens.\nDespite the great strides in the health sector in terms of legislation, the Philippines still faces many challenges, basic of which is the maldistribution of health workers in the country and the need to capacitate health centers especially those in the rural areas.\nThe country also contends with high dengue incidence, an HIV epidemic that is the fastest growing in the world, and the failure to meet health-related Millennium Development Goals such as reducing maternal mortality.\nThe Philippines has committed to achieving the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. Will the next administration work towards meeting health-related SDG targets?\nVice President Jejomar Binay\nBinay promised to provide free health care for all Filipinos, especially for the indigents and senior citizens. Services should also reach every Filipino, even those in far-flung areas, and as quickly as services reach those in urban areas.\nHe believes the country needs a comprehensive health program which strengthens and promotes preventive health care through nationwide vaccination, sanitation, and proper nutrition programs.\nFor Binay, it is important to put in place infrastructure, facilities, and support services and providers that will provide quality and complete health care services. He said this is as important as providing health coverage for all Filipinos.\nHe also wants to work with local government units (LGUs) and the private sector so that the poor can avail of free treatment in health facilities. The poor will also be provided free medicine under a Binay presidency.\nBinay vowed to support LGUs in the delivery of health and medical services, and to increase the compensation and benefits for public health workers. He wants every barangay to have at least one health worker, and water systems that will provide potable water to communities.\nDavao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte\nDuterte promised to prioritize health when it comes to the national budget, along with agriculture and education. He believes preventive health programs in the country, especially on providing adequate nutrition, must be \"sustainably pushed.\"\nIf he wins, Duterte will require all hospitals in the country to have a facility for indigent patients: at least 10 free beds for small hospitals, 20 for \"not so big\" hospitals, and 30 beds for big hospitals.\n\"When a person enters, you need to help them, cure them, operate on them. I will pay,\" he earlier said.\nHe proposed that government should shoulder the health care services in those facilities using the following fund sources: PhilHealth reserve funds, sin tax revenues, and the budget of the health department.\nSenator Grace Poe\nOne of the highlights of Poe's health agenda is the institutionalization of a Standard Lunch Program for all public schools in the country. Based on her estimate, about P40 billion will be needed to provide free meals to children in public day care centers and elementary schools.\nOn basic needs. Poe wants to modernize hospitals and make sure they are equipped with enough facilities, medicines, and manpower. She is open to harnessing the private sector to provide more hospitals and clinics in the country.\nAt the local level, Poe said it's important to provide health centers sufficient equipment and to give local communities full access to essential medicines and maintenance medicines. The government must provide these medicines especially to those who can't afford them.\nThe presidential candidate also vowed to fix hospitals and barangay centers destroyed by typhoons.\nOn health workers. Poe supports the move to increase the minimum salary of nurses to P25,000 per month. She vowed to push for the strict implementation of the Magna Carta for Health Workers that will provide hazard and subsistence allowances for the health workers.\nShe also made promises for barangay health workers and nursing interns in government hospitals. Barangay health workers under her administration will get regular salaries instead of allowances or an honorarium.\nNursing interns, meanwhile, will get paid in the government hospital they work in. If possible, these interns may also be hired by the hospital after they graduate.\nThis is in tune with a bill filed by Poe which, if enacted, will institutionalize the Government Internship Program and allot P100 million for the compensation and training of all government interns.\nOn PhilHealth. Poe is pushing for the expansion of health benefits under PhilHealth and the prioritization of preventive health care and maintenance.\nShe also wants to establish a voucher system so that patients can access for free, at any health facility, primary health care and outpatient services.\nPoe vowed to improve health care for the elderly. Under a Poe presidency, more fisherfolk families will also become PhilHealth members.\nThe senator also vowed to fulfill these specific promises:\nInfuse resources into the Eastern Samar Provincial Hospital in order to address the health needs of one of the poorest provinces in the country.\nFund the city hospital in San Carlos, Negros Occidental to improve its facilities.\nFix hospitals located in the country's top 30 poorest provinces.\nFormer Interior Secretary Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II\nRoxas wants to further expand PhilHealth coverage in the country and reduce Filipinos' out-of-pocket expenses. He also wants to address gaps in the utilization of health care services provided by the government.\nUnder his administration, he vowed to include in PhilHealth the provision of free maintenance medicines for all senior citizens. He also wants to continue the establishment of PhilHealth-accredited women and child centers in isolated barangays.\nRoxas said there is a need to sustain the provision of complete immunization of Filipinos, from infancy to adolescence and when they reach old age. He also wants health centers in the country to provide for the poor free maintenance medicines for conditions such as diabetes, symptomatic gout, leukemia, tuberculosis, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.\nBut before providing these health care services, Roxas said it's important to first ensure the availability of health workers and appropriate health facilities at different levels of care. This includes health stations for every barangay with enough manpower, equipment, and medicines.\nRoxas also vowed to further reduce drug prices through bulk procurement, and to properly implement the reproductive health law.\nSenator Miriam Defensor Santiago\nSantiago promised a government that will provide better health care for its citizens. She also wants to see the total eradication of extreme hunger in the Philippines by 2022. Health will be among her priorities when it comes to the national budget.\nSantiago is also for the expansion of PhilHealth coverage in the country, but she wants to establish \"progressive\" universal health care with benefit packages that cover needed health care interventions. She also wants another benefit package which exempts the poor from any payments.\nHer government, she said, will work on strengthening health systems to improve maternal and child health, instead of focusing on disease-driven initiatives. Santiago vowed to improve facilities in barangay health centers, equipping them with more vaccines and medicines.\nThe senator said she will oppose the privatization of hospitals and remove the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office practice requiring beneficiaries to bring endorsement letters from government officials. Santiago also vowed to fully implement the reproductive health law.",

    "title": "55 die daily in PH from lack of proper sewerage",
    "timestamp": "October 11, 2013 8:04 AM",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – Three boys scrambled for an inflatable red ball in Paco, Manila.\nThe ball was just a few inches from their fingertips, floating in one of the many esteros that crisscross the district. One of them grabbed it from the water and victoriously held it above his head, jubilant to find a toy that would occupy them the whole day.\nThe ball was wet from the grayish green waters of the creek – a creek choked with plastic bags, slimy sludge, and floating black flakes of suspicious origin. A few steps away, a toilet hidden from view by blocks of cement and wooden planks drains directly into the same creek.\nMost toilets in the area drain into this smelly creak beneath Zamora Bridge, said Clarence, one of the boys.\nThe lack of a \"pozo negro\" or underground container for manure and waste made this the cheapest and most convenient course of action for some Paco residents.\"Naghuhukay na lang po sila ng butas sa tabi ng estero (They just dig holes in the ground beside the creek),\" said 13-year-old Annie Casignia, a Paco resident, describing the makeshift toilets of some of her neighbors.\nPaco's lack of a proper sewerage system is symptomatic of the greater malady afflicting the entire country.\nMore than 20 million Filipinos still have no access to proper sanitation and sewage facilities. Only 10% of the population is connected to sewerage systems, according to statistics from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).\nThe problem refuses to stay underground. The country's crappy sewerage leads to economic loss of more than P78 billion a year. The largest chunk of the loss, 71%, goes to health impacts due to poor sanitation, according to a 2008 study by World Bank. Pollution of water resources accounts for 23% of economic costs while other welfare impacts and damage of poor sanitation to the tourism industry are responsible for the rest of the loss.\nAccording to the DENR, 55 people die daily from diseases caused by a lack of proper sewerage and sanitation facilities. These include leptospirosis, malaria, dengue, Hepatis A, Hepatitis E, and Typhoid fever.\nA flood of problems\nAnnie and her neighbors are used to the rancid smell emanating from the creek, but she fears the dirty body of water the most during storms.\nAt the height of Tropical Storm Ondoy in 2009, the creek's waters contributed to neck-high floods that drove residents to evacuate to higher ground. Annie and her brother had to swim through the flood waters.\nSoon after, her brother contracted leptospirosis, a fatal infection transmitted when water contaminated with rat urine comes into contact with skin wounds and eyes.\nOndoy's onslaught stopped and her brother got well, but the horrors weren't over.\"Noong humupa na po, mag-iigib sana kami ng tubig eh napansin nila ang itim na ng tubig ta's may mga buhangin-buhangin. So pinakuluan na lang namin 'yung tubig. Nagkasakit sa tiyan ng mga bata. Nagtae po 'yung mga bata,\" she recalled.\n(When the flood waters subsided, we pumped water from the ground. We noticed that the water was black and had what looked like sand in it. So we just boiled the water. The kids started to get stomach aches. They started to defecate uncontrollably.)\nDiseases and ailments caused by dirty water can be prevented by keeping well-maintained sewage facilities that stop wastewater from flowing into bodies of water like rivers, creeks, and lakes – which are almost always likely to happen during storms.\nResidents of Barangay 826, one of the communities living beside the creek under Zamora Bridge, have long asked for a septic tank from their barangay officials. Inaction by the local government forced the residents to put together a makeshift sewerage system.\nAntonio Repis, a resident since 1969, made his own underground pipeline and septic tank right beside the creek.\"Kaso pag hindi na kaya ng tanke, pumupunta sa estero 'yung dumi (But when the tank can't handle all the waste, the waste overflows to the creek),\" he said.\nSeptic tanks, containers that store waste and decompose them through bacterial action, are supposed to be emptied regularly. The DENR estimates that half of the country's septic tanks have not been emptied for the past 5 years, if at all.\nA 2009 study by the Asian Development Bank showed that unsanitary septic tanks contribute to 58% of the country's contaminated groundwater. The contamination has \"killed\" major bodies of water. Rivers are unable to sustain aquatic life, beaches are too dirty for swimming, waterborne diseases infect more people, and fishermen are forced to venture farther out to sea for a decent catch of fish.\nEstero cleanups are not enough to purify their creek's foulness, said Repis. To begin with, the cleanups are few and far between.\"Bihira lang sila naglilinis, kapag halalan, kapag inuutos ng Presidente (They seldom clean, only when there are elections or upon the order of the President).\"\nHe blames the \"squatters\" upstream for the creek's defilement. The creek that used to be full of waterlilies is swimming in garbage because of the lack of discipline of Filipinos, he complained.\nSolution in sight\nBy 2020, Paco's sewage problem should be solved – at least, as promised by a program recently launched by the DENR.\nThe National Sewerage and Septage Management Program (NSSMP) seeks to provide the entire country with proper sewerage and septage systems by 2020. It aims to achieve this by investing in infrastructure like sewage pipelines and wastewater treatment facilities – structures that remove biological or chemical waste from water, allowing the treated water to be used for other purposes.\nThe program will also improve the capability of local government units to build, operate, and maintain the facilities.\nThe NSSMP just wrapped up its initial phase, involving consultation between representatives of LGUs and water districts from the cities enrolled in the program.\nThe next phase would be the actual implementation of the program, installing sewerage and septage systems within the areas.\nLast March, a Program Operations Manual crafted by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) was released to guide LGUs on how to develop and maintain their sewerage and septage systems.\nThe NSSMP also identifies cities to be especially targeted by the initiative. Referred to as highly urbanized cities or HUCs, these areas suffer the most from bad sewerage due to overpopulation, pollution, and unchecked commercial developments.\nIncluded in the list are the cities of Baguio, Cebu, Angeles, Tacloban, San Pablo, General Santos, and Zamboanga.\nAs HUCs, they are set to receive funding from DPWH to cover 40% of capital costs for the cities' sewerage projects.\nThe ultimate goal is to connect all subdivisions, condominiums, commercial establishments, hotels, hospitals, public markets and government buildings to the sewerage system.\n“Unfortunately, as of 2010, only 30% of these areas had sewer coverage due to limitations in the sewerage network itself,\" said DENR Secretary Ramon Paje.\n“However, we are making resolute and palpable progress, and we hope to achieve 100% sewer coverage by 2018, provided we make the right investments.\"\nThere are already small but noteworthy steps in the right direction.\nA joint sewage-septage treatment plant in Veterans Village in Project 7, Quezon City, can treat 2,400 cubic meters of sewage generated daily by residents. On top of that, it can treat 240 cubic meters of sewage from nearby areas.\nA low-cost, small-scale wastewater treatment facility installed by the Muntinlupa City government cleans 210 cubic meters a day. The treated water is then recycled for cleaning and flushing water for toilets.\nBack in Manila's Barangay 826, Repis was happy to hear about the government's plans. His only worry was that good old laziness and lack of discipline would get in the way.\n\"Nasanay na kasi ang mga tao dito. Mas madali kasi yung ginagawa nila ngayon. (The people here are so used to status quo. The way things are being done now is easier).\"\nAs for the 3 boys with the red ball, a hope remains that, one day, toys picked up from a creek would be nothing to worry about.",

Garin, while the DOHhas conducted some form of supplemental immunization program, there is a possibility of cases of measles that maybe experienced by some people in certain areas.\n\"Of course, we’re hoping that this will not happen because we have already conducted immunization in some areas… But still there is a need to remain vigilant and be in the preventive side,\" she stressed.\nShe said that because of such possibility, there is a need to be more cautious and aware of the importance of vaccinating the children against measles.\n\"So, kailangan pa rin ng pag-iingat at pagpapabakuna ng mga bata,\" she added.\nGarin said measles can be easily spread to other people if a patient passes by or is in the same place where some people without measles are also staying because it can be spread through the air or airborne.\nShe also said that most vulnerable to it are children, pregnant women and those with weak immune system who are exposed to patients with measles.\nTo reduce the risk of spreading the disease, it is important that a herd immunity is achieved through the immunization program being done by the government to fight it both in the community level and in the school through the school-based immunization.\nPregnant women, children most vulnerable\nGarin explained that by having herd immunity, the most vulnerable ones like children and pregnant women will somehow be protected.\nShe reminded that German measles among pregnant women can cause some birth defects or affect the fetus of the mother.\nIt is therefore important that pregnant mothers are protected against it.\nIf someone in the house has measles, the patient is advised to stay there at least four days from the date that he or she first developed the measles rash so he/she can help in reducing the risk of spreading it to others.\nAccording to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, rubella or German measles is dangerous for pregnant women and unborn babies.\nThis disease is often mild with half of the people having it not realizing that they are sick.\nA rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.\nThe rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy.\nRubella is usually spread through the air via coughs of people who are infected.\nPeople are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash.\nThe most serious complication from rubella infection is the harm it can cause to a pregnant woman's unborn baby.\nIf an unvaccinated pregnant woman gets infected with rubella virus, she can have a miscarriage, or her baby can die just after birth.\nAlso, the woman can pass the virus to her unborn baby who can develop serious birth defects such as heart problems, loss of hearing and eyesight, intellectual disability, and liver or spleen damage.\nSerious birth defects are more common if a woman is infected early in her pregnancy, especially in the first trimester.",

There have been reported cases of measles in unimmunized Canadian travellers returning from the Philippines,\" the advisory said.\n\"The Public Health Agency of Canada reminds travellers to make sure their measles vaccination is up-to-date. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It is one of the leading causes of death in children worldwide,\" it added.\nOther countries where the Canadian government said measles is endemic and where periodic large outbreaks occur include Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom.\nIt also cited a significant increase in the number of cases in Brazil compared to 2013, as well as outbreaks due to imported cases in the United States.\nAlso, the Canadian travel health notice pointed out measles cases occur worldwide.\nWhile the number of measles cases reported globally has decreased significantly in the last 10 years, there have been large outbreaks, mostly in Africa and Europe.\n\"The Americas, including Canada, have experienced outbreaks of measles, when the virus has been imported from other regions,\" it said.\n\"Travellers who are not immune to measles (those who have not been vaccinated or have not been infected with the disease) have an increased risk of infection. For example, travel through international airports, including those in Canada, may increase your chance of exposure to the disease,\" it added.\nRecommendations\nThe Canadian government recommended that travelers consult a health care provider or visit a travel health clinic \"preferably six weeks before\" travel, and to get vaccinated.\nFor infants and children, it recommended two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, the first at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 18 months of age, typically before school entry.\n\"During outbreaks or for travel to regions where measles is a concern, the vaccine may be given as early as six months of age. Under these circumstances, the routine two dose series must be then restarted on or after the first birthday, for a total of three doses,\" it said.\nFor adults born in or after 1970, they should make sure that they have received two doses of measles-containing vaccine.\nOther recommendations include:\n- Wash your hands frequently\nWash your hands with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds, as often as possible.\nUse alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.\nPractice proper cough and sneeze etiquette. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs.\nIf you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards.",

    "timestamp": "2013-10-20T16:15:00",
    "content": "NEW DELHI, India – Factory worker Mohammad Awwal is gripped by fever, sweats and the sort of agonizing aches that mean his condition is sometimes called \"breakbone disease\". It's an annual plague in India and a hidden epidemic, say experts. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease with no known cure or vaccination that strikes fear into the citizens of New Delhi when it arrives with the monsoon rains – just as the scorching heat of the summer is subsiding. Hospital wards are overwhelmed and tales abound of deaths and cases while New Delhi public authorities insist that only 3,500 have fallen sick so far this year – with only five fatalities. \"I took him first to a government hospital. I was shocked to see that it was packed with dengue patients. There was not even a single bed available,\" said Awwal's mother, Mehrunissa, sitting in her one-room shack in east Delhi. She is now treating him at their home, giving him multi-vitamins, paracetamol and water as he lies on the floor with two pillows and a bedsheet but no mattress. In a sign that this year's outbreak could be as bad as record-breaking 2010, the city's largest public hospital, Hindu Rao, announced earlier this month that it had suspended all routine surgeries to make room for more dengue patients. The Delhi government has blamed prolonged monsoons for the hike in infections, but says it has added beds at hospitals and increased resources for spraying insecticides to tackle the mosquito menace. \"It's nothing to worry about, there is no crisis,\" Charan Singh, additional director of Delhi health services, told AFP, dismissing allegations that the city of 17 million under-reports the problem. \"It is a lot of hype going on... The government is in action and we report all cases according to international guidelines,\" he added. Fear of a panic? The virus – first detected in the 1950s in the Philippines and Thailand – affects two million people across the globe annually, with the number of cases up 30 times in the last 50 years, according to the World Health Organisation. Transmitted to humans by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito, it causes high fever, headaches, itching and joint pains that last about a week. There are four strains, one of which can cause fatal internal bleeding. In India, cases have increased sharply over the last five years – there have been 38,000 so far in 2013 – but doctors say these numbers only capture part of the problem. At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), India's most prestigious public hospital, doctors are overwhelmed by patients whose beds are squeezed together like Tetris tiles in the emergency ward with saline drips nailed to the walls. Medics, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Agence France-Presse that they were seeing 60 new dengue patients a day – an influx they suspected was not reflected in the official figures. \"Maybe it's because they don't want to create panic or because they don't want to be blamed, but if they hide, people won't know how bad the situation is,\" said one doctor. The former health chief at the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) said that only positive results from one of the two standard dengue tests – known as ELISA test – was registered. \"There is gross under-reporting of these cases every year. I believe the real numbers are always three times higher than those projected by the MCD,\" V.K. Monga told Agence France-Presse. Sandeep Budhiraja, internal medicines director at private Max Healthcare hospital in Delhi, blamed city authorities for failing to be prepared and said cases would only decline with the onset of winter next month. \"It's an epidemic that hits the country every year, yet there is never any preparedness by officials. It just keeps getting worse,\" said Budhiraja, adding that Max had opened its fever wards to accommodate dengue patients. 'No luck' with treatments While dengue is painful and debilitating, death is usually rare but patients are vulnerable to other fatal viral infections during or shortly after the time of illness. There is still no specific treatment, but last year French healthcare giant Sanofi Pasteur said it would begin tests for a dengue vaccine in India before making it available internationally by 2015. A leading Brazilian biomedical research institute, Butantan, also said last month it was working on a new dengue vaccine that they hoped would be ready by 2018. British firm Oxitec has also created genetically modified sterile male Aedes mosquitoes - what they call \"birth control for insects\" - but met with severe criticism for releasing unnatural species into the environment. The only defense so far is preventive steps, like removing stagnant water near residential areas, spraying insecticide, applying mosquito repellent and wearing long sleeves and trousers. Many victims in India gulp down papaya-leaf juice believing it to boost blood platelet levels, which are decimated by the virus. \"It is a largely preventive, self-limiting virus, but we still hardly invest in research for treatments,\" said Budhiraja from Max Healthcare. \"There are only some vaccines being tried out, but no luck yet.\"",

    "content": "ISABELA, Philippines – The rainy season has just started, but the municipality of Luna in Isabela province in the northern Philippines already declared state of calamity after their health office recorded 54 cases of dengue in just the month of June. Dengue is a fever, usually fatal, caused by a bite of Aedes mosquito. It targets the immune system of the body. Dr Claire Francisco, Luna’s health officer, said on Tuesday, June 30, the number of cases reported for the month is “significantly\" higher compared to the numbers reported in the same month in previous years. Although there is no case of death from dengue yet, the increase in the reported cases of the disease prompted the local government unit to declare a state of calamity to be able to release funds for the purchase of medical equipment. Francisco said the purchase of equipment will also be anticipation of more cases during the rainy season. Thirteen out of 19 barangays (villages) in the town were affected, she said. Francisco advised residents to maintain cleanliness and get rid of stagnant waters so dengue-causing mosquitoes would not have places to breed in. Rising cases In April, the Department of Health (DOH) reported 6.49% increase of dengue cases in the country, citing 19,946 cases in the first quarter of 2015. The number reached 744 in Cagayan Valley, while Calabarzon had the highest with 3,778 and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) had the lowest with 312. Philhealth subsidizes dengue case confinement with to P31,300 for level 3. The subsidy covers the maximum allowable expense for room, drugs and medicines, and laboratory tests. The health department is expecting the number of dengue cases to peak in the months of July and August.",

    "content": "TOKYO, Japan Japanese health officials said Thursday that three young people have contracted dengue fever, the first such infections in the country in nearly 70 years. The three are suspected of having contracted the disease when they were bitten by mosquitos in Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo, officials said. The patients – a man in his 20s in Tokyo as well as a teen and woman in her 20s in Saitama Prefecture north of the capital – go to the same educational institution in Tokyo. None of them is in a life-threatening condition, officials said. The last domestic infection of dengue fever was in 1945, although there are around 200 cases annually among those who have travelled abroad, mainly in Southeast Asia. Dengue fever is not transmitted directly from person-to-person and symptoms range from mild fever, to incapacitating high temperatures, according to the World Health Organization. There is no vaccine or any specific medicine to treat dengue and patients should rest, drink plenty of fluids and reduce the fever using paracetamol or see a doctor, it says. The disease is carried by the tiger mosquito, which are widespread across Japan. Japanese officials say they have not detected the dengue virus in mosquitos caught in Yoyogi Park but they will disinfect areas where sufferers were bitten. Yoyogi Park, which sits next to the grand Meiji Jingu Shrine and is one of central Tokyo's biggest public green spaces, is popular with Tokyoites and tourists alike. After the news, the share prices of home pesticide makers shot up on the Tokyo market, with Fumakilla up 24.46% at 407 yen. Earth Chemical also rose 8.07% to 4,285 yen.",

    "content": "ILOILO, Philippines – The number of dengue cases has surged in this Western Visayas province, infecting more than 1,800 people and killing at least 10, a provincial official said Saturday, July 6. The number of people struck down by the mosquito-borne disease in Iloilo this year is already 71% higher than the same period last year, provincial administrator Raul Banias told Agence France-Presse. He added dengue fatalities in the first half of 2013 were already equal to the total deaths for the whole of 2012. The latest outbreak in the province, located around 400 kilometers south of Manila, has caused particular alarm, because it began before the start of rainy season in June, when mosquitoes are less plentiful, he said. He added that the outbreak may be a sign of the changing behavior of mosquitoes and a result of people storing water improperly. Dengue is spread by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water and usually bite people during daytime. \"But the behavior of the mosquitoes has changed. They are no longer biting only during the day. Even at night, they are biting,\" he said. Additionally, many of the 1.6 million people living in the largely-rural province still stockpile water in their homes due to lack of proper plumbing, making it easier for the mosquitoes to breed. Provincial health workers are now being deployed to the hardest-hit areas to inspect homes, searching for any water container where the mosquitoes might breed, Banias said. Residents are also being advised to keep their water containers covered while victims are being given free treatment in government hospitals, he said. Dengue fever is a recurring problem in the Philippines. While the number of incidents this year is slightly lower nationwide, it has been spiking in certain areas such as Iloilo.",

In 2011, the local health office documented a total of 896 cases during the same period, according to Melody Pabante, pest control officer of the Davao City's health office. Pabante added that the highest number of incidents this year was recorded during the month of August: 1,069 cases. A total of 42 dengue victims from the city have died since January. Clemarie Secuya, a 3rd year Computer Science student in Ateneo de Davao University, suffered from dengue days after school opened in June this year. “I thought it was just an ordinary case of fever due to the weather that time. I tried taking medicines but my temperature kept on rising,” Secuya recalled. She added that after 3 days of high fever, her mother brought her to the hospital. \"When I had my blood checked, we discovered that my platelets were already very low because of dengue,\" Secuya narrated. \"We tried every treatment available including herbal medicine like tawa-tawa and even durian, which is believed to be an effective treatment,\" said Secuya. Fortunately, the combination of traditional and alternative medicine was effective, she said. The city health office said the local government is trying its best to regularly remind residents to clean their surroundings to keep dengue mosquitoes away. Aside from information campaign, the local government also conducts fogging in different villages in the city. But fogging is a mere stop-gap measure, Pabante added. She said that the health office has also been distributing Olyset-treated curtains and ovicidal larvicidal (OL) traps to address the problem. In partnership with the Department of Education, Pabante said that the local government was successful in setting up OL traps and Olyset curtains in all public schools in the city. \"The increase is really alarming. We are hoping that the people would act on this. The efforts of the residents in removing the breeding ground of mosquitoes is the best solution,\" Pabante said.",

The 3 casualties – from 3 different villages – were aged 4, 8, and 16, City Health Officer Dr James Guzman told Rappler. Based on the historical data, the previous years' cases are much higher. The city health office only recorded 188 cases since January. But Guzman said the 3 casualties alarmed them enough to declare an outbreak. \"It is not normal to have one death in every 60 cases in the history of dengue in Tuguegarao,\" Guzman said. Mayor Jefferson Soriano ordered the city health office to conduct assessment and information drive about the disease. Guzman said they already mobilized barangay health officers and schools to ensure sanitation. He said that two of those who died likely got the disease in their homes because they were not attending school. A few weeks ago, another area in Cagayan Valley – the municipality of Luna in Isabela province – declared a state of calamity after its health office recorded 54 cases of dengue in just the month of June. In the first quarter of 2015, the health department reported 20,000 cases of dengue nationwide. On Friday, Isabela Governor Faustino Dy II declared a non-working holiday so residents could participate in an anti-dengue cleanup drive and bloodletting activities. As of July 2, the provincial health office recorded about 748 cases of dengue in the province since January, with 2 deaths in Santiago City. \"The rise in dengue fever cases necessitates public support to sustain the supply of blood reserves in government hospitals to meet the needs of critical dengue patients who undergo immediate blood transfusion,\" Dy said. Free blood testing services were offered at 4 government hospitals across the province: the Governor Faustino N.

Health officials in Santiago said two new dengue cases were confirmed Saturday, February 20, on Easter Island in two women, ages 20 and 52. \"One of them required hospitalization after displaying serious symptoms,\" Chile's health department said in a statement, who said the woman at present is in good condition. Authorities said they are also monitoring the population for Zika virus, and that about a dozen people suspected of having the disease are under observation. Both dengue and Zika are transmitted by the same mosquito, aedes aegypti. Officials worry that the dengue outbreak could hurt tourism, a major source of revenue. Several nations in Latin America and the Caribbean have seen serious outbreaks of Zika, which officials suspect of causing birth defects in infants, and other potentially serious health concerns.

This is 15.8% higher compared to the same period in 2015 (72,627), and out of this number, 372 people died. Dengue is a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world. It is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito, according to the World Health Organization. The Philippines is one of 4 countries in the Western Pacific which reported the highest dengue incidence in recent years. According to the health department, most of the dengue cases in the country were from Calabarzon (11.2%), Central Visayas (9.5%), Northern Mindanao (9.3%), Western Visayas and Soccsksargen (8.9%), and Central Luzon (8.5%) There were 585 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases in the country. Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children. Among the hundreds who died, for instance, the age group with the highest case fatality rate is composed of children who are less than one year old. Central Visayas has so far the highest number of deaths this year, with 65 recorded deaths as of August 6. The DOH has already identified around 80 barangays (villages) in the country as dengue clusters or \"hot zones.\" These are areas that reported 3 or more dengue cases for the past 4 straight weeks. Health Spokesperson Eric Tayag earlier said if the cases in a cluster continue to rise, it could indicate a possible dengue outbreak in that barangay, especially if deaths were reported in the area.",

The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, July 31, reported a 7.7% drop in the cases of dengue from 67,339 in July 2012 to 62,156 today. DOH Secretary Enrique Ona noted the significant decline of dengue cases in Luzon. In the National Capital Region, cases of the infectious disease went down by 69% based on DOH data. The region recorded the highest decline in the entire country. The Visayas and Mindanao, however, reported a surge of dengue cases. The uptick was pegged at 53% in Visayas and 44% in Mindanao. The DOH said the alarming figures outside of Luzon can be due to “higher amounts of precipitation” experienced in those areas during the first half of the year. Last year, Mindanao’s Davao City registered a 300% increase in the cases of dengue fever. On July 6, Iloilo province of Western Visayas also reported a 71% surge. Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease frequently occurring in tropical and sub-tropical regions that may lead to lethal complications. Loss of lives Emily Divinagracia lost her brother to dengue in the 1980s. \"What it did was bring home the fact that those abstract morbidity and mortality figures… aren't abstract at all—that these are real people, leading real lives, whose illnesses affect real families,\" she said. In an e-mail to Rappler, Divinagracia recalled her brother’s sudden demise at the age of 27. \"After graduating from UP Law as the president of his class, passing the bar exams in the top 20, and working at the Supreme Court under then-Justice Irene Cortes, my brother John caught dengue fever and passed away from dengue hemorrhagic shock after 5 days in hospital,\" she narrated. Divinagracia herself took up medicine at the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila. She said the virus-carrying mosquitoes could have come from anywhere–\"water in pails, improperly-covered containers, long stagnant puddles because of rain, coupled with poor drainage.\" New treatment guidelines This year, dengue fatalities dropped to 263 cases. The death toll is 40% lower than last year’s 435 during this same period. The DOH said new treatment guidelines now focus on earlier replenishment of body fluids. The health agency issues and updates clinical pathways – a standardized management of diseases – disseminated to doctors in public hospitals across the county. Divinagracia who experienced the impact of the disease first-hand – during her brother’s death in the 80s and when she was diagnosed with dengue in 1997 – said early detection would help Filipino families. \"The sort of rapid screening tests available today weren't available 24 years ago, which means supportive therapy can be started much earlier than before,\" she said. Chikungunya outbreak Meanwhile, Ona said on Wednesday, July 31, that it was only a matter of time before the Chikungunya virus hit the Philippines. A surge of cases, he said, had already been reported in Thailand and Singapore last year. \"Chikungkunya is a viral disease similar to dengue,\" the health secretary said. \"Less ang chance of dying. However, mas matagal ang side effects (The chance of dying is less. However, the side effects last longer).\" The Philippine Star reported an outbreak of the disease in 10 Philippine municipalities. The health chief added that sore muscles are often experienced even after one is healed. \"It is even difficult to differentiate it from an ordinary flu, except mas matindi ang (there is worse) muscle and joint pain,\" he explained. DOH efforts Ona encouraged local governments to step up their anti-dengue campaigns as more frequent rains will\"“herald increased mosquito population that thrive in stagnant water.\" The DOH is currently monitoring the Ovicidal-Larvicidal (OL) mosquito traps – an innovation introduced through a joint project with other government agencies – placed in schools and communities. (READ: Crowdsourcing dengue alert) A habit of searching for and eliminating mosquito-breeding sites in local communities at least once a week was also launched by the DOH. The strategy needs collective community efforts, with the searches routinely done 4 pm onwards.",

    "content": " The Department of Health said Saturday that dengue cases nationwide have decreased by 32 percent this year, radio dzBB Mao dela Cruz reported Saturday.DOH's records show that the number of dengue cases dropped by 31.8 percent compared to year's tally.From 211,000 cases in same spot period in 2016, the number is down to 143,902 this year.But despite the decrease in the number dengue cases in the country, DOH said efforts to combat the mosquito-borne virus would remain relentless.In a statement on Thursday, DOH said most of the dengue cases in 2017 were from the following regions: Central Visayas Region (15.5%), Central Luzon Region (13%), National Capital Region (12.2%), CALABARZON Region (11.4%) and SOCCSKSARGEN Region (11.1%).Meanwhile, DOH Secretary Paulyn Ubial pointed out that addressing the dengue scourge should begin at the grassroots level.\"The significance of addressing dengue at the barangay level is to overcome its detrimental impact of instigating economic burden and hindering our development goals. The first step to prevent dengue is within our homes, it is important to instill cleanliness in our surroundings and empty containers with stagnant waters to eliminate the breeding places of mosquitoes,\" Ubial added.",

    "title": "DOH: Mild dengue cases can be managed at home",
    "timestamp": "September 2, 2010 5:01pm",
    "content": "The Department of Health (DOH) assured the public that mild dengue cases can be managed at home and not all cases require hospitalization. Dr. Eric Tayag, Chief of the DOH National Epidemiology Center (NEC), said a dengue case is usually considered 'mild' when a dengue patient seeks medical attention early and is diagnosed immediately. \"Kaya mas maraming mild [cases] sapagkat mas maraming maagang pumupunta sa ospital ngayon, na gusto nating mangyari (There are a lot of mild cases recently because many patients go to hospitals immediately, which is exactly what we want),\" he said. \"Lumalabas na mild kasi maaga silang nagpapatingin (The dengue appears mild because they seek early consultation).\" The DOH devised an easy-to-remember D.E.N.G.U.E. acronym to educate the public on home treatment of mild dengue cases. It stands for: Daily monitoring of patient's status Encourage intake of oral fluids Note any dengue warning signs like persistent vomiting and bleeding Give paracetamol, not aspirin Use mosquito nets Early consultation is advised Home treatment of mild dengue cases, will also help decongest public hospitals that barely have room for more patients, the DOH said. Dengue patients are usually admitted to hospitals for blood transfusion and replacement of lost fluids. However, when dengue is diagnosed early, a patient can be managed at home by encouraging intake of oral fluids or oral glucose electrolyte solution. According to the DOH, an oral solution of one liter of water, eight teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon salt can act as a substitute for an oral glucose electrolyte solution. Tayag reminds the public to be wary of perceived cures to dengue like camote tops, raw papaya juice and tawa-tawa tea. He said that these home remedies may either aggravate or cure, depending on the degree of the patient's sickness. \"Hindi namin tahasang nirerekomenda, hindi rin naman namin ipinagbabawal, pero mas maigi na po na 'wag kayong magkaroon ng false sense of security sapagkat baka akala niyo gamot iyan. Wala pong gamot ang dengue,\" he said. (We are neither recommending nor disputing these home remedies, but it's best to not have a false sense of security because you might think these remedies cure dengue. There is no medicine for dengue.) As of August 21, 2010, a total of 62, 503 cases were reported, almost 90% higher compared to the number of cases in the same time period last year. The year 2009 currently has the highest number of dengue cases in the country. However, DOH earlier said the number of cases could reach 80,000 by the end of the year, and could even be much higher than the 2009 record. Region 6, 4-A and 12 have the most number of dengue cases reported from January 1 to August 21, 2010. Four hundred sixty five deaths were recorded nationwide. DOH ramps up info campaign The DOH has also heightened its public education and information campaign against dengue. DOH is giving out this dengue health advisory pamphlet at LRT stations. Click here to download Earlier this month, the DOH started their school visits to disseminate dengue information to pupils. Now they are bringing dengue prevention data to Light Rail Transit (LRT) stations around the metro. On Thursday, DOH Secretary Dr. Enrique Ona visited the LRT-Monumento station in Caloocan to unveil an information tarpaulin that will be posted in all LRT stations. Ona also gave away health advisory pamphlets that remind the public about dengue prevention. These pamphlets and information materials are not only for preventing dengue but also for preventing other rainy season diseases like flu, cough, and sore eyes. The Health chief reminded the public to keep these preventive measures in mind, especially when they ride public vehicles. \"Laging iniisip ito lalu na sa LRT kung saan ang mga pasahero natin ay kumpol-kumpol at magkakalapit-lapit (Remember this especially when you ride the LRT, where passengers stand close together),\" he said. \"Kapag uubo, takpan ang ating bibig. 'Pag uwi, hugasan ninyo ang inyong kamay with soap and water (Cover your mouth when you cough and when you get home, wash your hands with soap and water),\" he said, adding that failing to do these simple sanitary measures increase the possibility of spreading diseases like flu and sore eyes. The DOH also played the Dengue jingle, which reminds people to clean their houses and destroy breeding grounds of dengue-carrying mosquitoes. Listen to the Department of Health's DENGUE JINGLE The song goes, \"Alam mo ba, alam mo ba, kung walang kiti-kiti, walang lamok. Alam mo ba, alam mo ba, kung walang lamok, walang dengue.\"",

    "timestamp": "June 15, 2013 4:06am",
    "content": "The DOH's National Epidemiology Center said the total figure represents a one-percent decline, or 456 fewer cases, compared to the same period in 2012. A breakdown of data showed that most of the dengue cases from Jan. 1 to June 8 were recorded in: - Central Visayas (6,023 cases, 51-percent increase) - Calabarzon (4,742, 17-percent decrease) - Davao Region (4,364, 30-percent increase) - Western Visayas (4,444, 102-percent increase) - SOCCKSARGEN (3,963, 126-percent increase). “Dengue needs urgent action and we need it now. In the absence of the usual cures and vaccines, we have to rely on the basics of early prevention and community action,” DOH Secretary Enrique Ona said on the department's Facebook page Friday. Metro Manila had 3,073 cases or 6,208 fewer cases - a 67-percent decrease, with Quezon City having 617 cases or a 77-percent decrease; Manila with 542 cases or a 65-percent decrease; Caloocan with 345 cases or a 67-percent decrease; Parañaque with 188 cases or a 67-percent decrease; and Valenzuela with 186 cases or a 62-percent decrease. Yet Ona reminded residents in areas that had fewer cases not to be complacent since dengue cases may peak in August and September. The DOH also noted areas at high risk include urban centers where there is poor environmental management of household waste. Community-based system The DOH has called for a community-based, local government unit-initiated dengue control program starting in households. Such a program reaches out to schools and other mosquito-dense areas in the community. According to the DOH, dengue-carrying mosquitoes breed in artificial containers as well as old tires, puddles and empty coconut shells. “The battle against dengue can be won right in our own backyards but this will not be easy for each one of us,” Ona said. Multi-agency effort The DOH entered into a pact with the Departments of Interior & Local Government (DILG), Science and Technology (DOST), and Education (DepEd) to work together in controlling dengue. \"DILG will lead all LGUs to implement the Aksyon Barangay Kontra Dengue in high-risk communities; DOST and DepEd together with DOH will scale up the home-grown ovi-larva (OL)-trap technology in selected, priority schools. The new set of local chief executives can easily make dengue control one of their top priorities,\" the DOH said. On the other hand, the DOH noted 2013 is the third year since June 15 was declared ASEAN Dengue Day during the 10th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting in Singapore on July 22, 2010. ASEAN Dengue Day promotes a shift from reactionary strategies to forward-planning and long-term prevention strategies. Ona will spearhead the Philippines' ASEAN Dengue Day observance in Cebu, while Vietnam hosts all countries in the region in this year’s region-wide campaign. 4 o'clock habit Earlier this year, the DOH relaunched the 4 o'clock habit where residents map out high risk areas in a locality, and organized teams to undertake critical response activities. This also involves the \"Stop, Look and Listen\" system where \"Stop\" means dropping everything in favor of mosquito control. \"Look\" means assigned teams carry out systematic “search and destroy” activities starting 4 p.m. \"Listen\" means heeding instructions of local authorities, community leaders, or work supervisors for synchronous implementation of the 4 o’clock habit. \"This can be done on a daily basis, or at least on a weekly basis based on institutional capacity and prevailing resources,\" the DOH said.",

While 24 deaths have been reported in Negros Occidental – 8 of which were in Bacolod City – since January of this year, the provincial government has yet to declare a state of calamity.\nAs Provincial Health Officer Ernell Tumimbang explained on Thursday, September 1, \"we’re not entertaining declaring a state of calamity because that’s counterproductive. We’re making necessary interventions. If it’s beyond control, even with the conduct of emergency fogging and larvicide treatment, then that’s the time we can declare to prepare for the worst scenario later on as dengue patients may storm the hospitals.\"\nHe added that it’s \"not alarming\" even if the cases have already reached the epidemic level.\nTumimbang also said the provincial health office will continue with the emergency fogging and larvicide treatment in localities with high dengue incidence.\nThere were two deaths in the same period last year, though the data for Negros Occidental did not include Bacolod at the time.\nThe dengue death toll in the province increased after 4 more fatalities were reported in the past week.\nAside from the 8 deaths in Bacolod City, fatalities were reported in the cities of La Carlota, San Carlos, Silay and Talisay with two each; and one each in the cities of Bago and Sagay, and the towns of E.B.

Cases usually shoot up there are new serotype strains. There is a possibility that the older serotype 2 strain has been replaced with a new one, making the populace more vulnerable,\" Tayag explained.\nOf the 4 \"serotype\" strains or variation of dengue viruses, types 2 and 3 are the most common in the country.\nAccording to DOH, those who get infected with the common dengue serotypes develop immunity from these strains until the following year. If serotype 4, for instance, will spread as a predominant strain in an area, this will make most people susceptible to the disease.\nAmong the areas in Mindanao, Zamboanga City is apparently vulnerable to dengue fever since DOH discovered all serotypes there.\n\"During the 2010 outbreak, it was confirmed that dengue serotype 4, which increases the chances of fatality among those infected with disease, was already existing in Zamboanga City,\" said Dr Norvie Taruc-Jalani of the DOH's Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit.\nDouble whammy\nThis is seen as a double whammy for the city since the new strain is not only “deadlier,” but also raises the risk of infecting more people.\nZamboanga City health chief Rodel Agbulos said 600 dengue patients were recorded in the city from January to March this year, which is double the number of cases compared to the same period in 2011. At least 9 of the patients have died.\nThe city government has re-intensified the campaign community clean-up drive and educating the public to fight dengue fever.\nAt least 130,000 dengue cases were recorded throughout the country last year, DOH records show.\nIn Metro Manila, the serotype 2 remains the dominant strain, according to Tayag.\nBut he warned that migration or people traveling to Mindanao may contract the strain and may contribute to its transmission to the metropolis.",

Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children.\nWHO said dengue is a \"disease of the future\" because of \"increased urbanization, scarce water supplies, and, possibly, environmental and climate change.\"\nNTDs, meanwhile, are infections caused by a variety of pathogens that affect more than 1 billion people worldwide. These diseases are endemic in 149 countries, according to WHO.\nPart of the proposed Sustainable Development Goals is to end NTDs like dengue by 2030. To do this, WHO urged countries to invest billions of dollars to combat the diseases.\nInvest to fight dengue\nIn the report, WHO said island nations in the Western Pacific such as Fiji are susceptible to dengue epidemics. Malaysia and Singapore also reported a sustained epidemic activity from 2013 to 2014.\n\"Diagnosis and management remain a challenge, with all efforts now focused on vector control with active community involvement,\" the report said of dengue in the region.\nTo sustain vector control worldwide, WHO said the needed investment target is an average of $510 million per year from 2015 to 2030. The figure may continue to increase in the context of climate change.\nAnd while a dengue vaccine is already in the works, the UN health agency said its introduction may only \"re-program\" some of the investment in vector control towards immunization. Vector control is still cost-effective to combat dengue.\n\"Investments in vector control should therefore be seen as complementary to the development and implementation of a future dengue prevention and control strategy. As the disease continues to expand to newer areas, vector control alone can prevent and reduce outbreaks,\" the report said.\nIn the Philippines, a dengue vaccine tested in the country and 4 other Asian countries showed promising overall efficacy and will be available in the health department’s vaccine program by July 2015.\nChallenges ahead\nAlthough dengue and chikungunya \"continue to spread at an alarming pace,\" WHO said significant progress has been made against these diseases.\n\"Trends indicate declining mortality [due to dengue], but morbidity has continued to increase, due partly to better reporting systems,\" the report said.\nTo reduce the burden of dengue, vector control must complement with other measures such as effective surveillance, prevention, and outbreak response.Challenges in the next 15 years include:\nshortage of trained health workers\nabsence of integrated vector-control programs\ndegree of readiness in some countries to implement WHO-recommended integrated programs comprehensively\n\"Control of dengue is technically feasible with coordinated international technical and financial support for national programmes, and has proven effective in reducing the global burden of malaria,\" WHO said.",

Disposing stagnant water should be effortless, she said.\nElsewhere, in July, a dengue outbreak was declared in Tuguegarao City in Cagayan province in the northern Philippines.

The Department of Health (DOH) said there is enough time as it prepares for a nationwide vaccination September this year. This is the long-term solution of the department for its target of a measles-free nation by 2017\n\"Isa tayo sa pinakaunang bansa na nag-target sa measles elimination (We're one of the first countries to target measles elimination),” Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said in a forum Tuesday, January 7. He said being measles-free means that in a population of 100 million, the laboratory-confirmed cases should not exceed 100 people. Last year, the confirmed cases numbered 1,724. The Philippine population is 92.34 million based on the 2010 census, but the Commission on Population expected the number to reach 97.7 milllion by 2013. (READ: DOH steps up drive vs measles amid outbreak) Tayag said the mass immunization will be conducted for the whole month of September, targeting 13 million children nationwide. Measles is a viral, highly-contagious respiratory disease. Infected persons exhibit symptoms such as high fever, red eyes, runny nose and cough. Rashes appear throughout the body after two days. The illness can be spread through cough or direct contact with body secretions of an infected person. A person with measles can pass the disease on to 18 other people. Role of LGUs Tayag urged parents in areas with a measles outbreak to have their children vaccinated regardless of whether they were already vaccinated or not. Some 21 barangays in 9 cities have declared an outbreak in their areas, according to state-run Philippine News Agency. These barangays include: Caloocan City: Bagong Barrio and Dagat-dagatan Las Piñas City: Pamplona Uno, Talon Dos, and Talon Singko Malabon City: Longos and Tonsuya Manila: Binondo, Quiapo, Port Area, Sampaloc, Sta. Cruz, Sta. Mesa, and Tondo Muntinlupa City: Alabang and Putatan Navotas: North Bay Boulevard South Parañaque City: Don Bosco and Moonwalk Taguig City: Bagong Tanyag Valenzuela City: Ugong Tayag said it takes the department two weeks to get confirmation, but at the local government level, a suspected case already prompts an investigation. Valenzuela Rep Sherwin Gatchalian told the department that LGUs can play a big role in preventing the upsurge of measles cases in the National Capital Region through information and mass vaccination. (READ: DOH: Measles upsurge due to kids missing free vaccination) \"We cannot rely on national government all the time since things like these are best managed at the local level...I’m appealing to the DOH to immediately convene a health summit to review the level of preparedness of LGUs and at the same time set a standard ‘emergency response template’ should there be any outbreak,\" he added. Health Secretary Enrique Ona said a measles outbreak mean\n\"there have been cases of a disease – either suspected or confirmed – in a community or a locality where in the past there was none.\" For Tayag, it means any barangay or district with at least one laboratory-confirmed case. “Lahat ng baby starting 6 months hanggang 59 months bibigyan ng bakuna regardless kung nagkatigdas na o tumanggap na ng bakuna – maliban na lang kung less than a month lang yung bakuna,” he added. (All babies starting 6 months until 59 months will be vaccinated regardless of whether they already had measles or they were already vaccinated – unless the vaccination was administered less than a month ago.) No overdose But the vaccination of children aged 6 months old is only recommended for places with an outbreak. This is 3 months earlier than the prescribed age for the first vaccine (9 to 11 months) which they should still get, as well as the booster shot at 15 months old. The first vaccine is 90% effective, while the booster is 100% effective, Tayag said. “Between isang bakuna at wala, lamang ang isang bakuna. Kaya kahit alam namin na baka di siya maproteksyunan...yung may bakuna, lamang na lamang dun sa 'di nakatanggap ng bakuna. Subali't alam namin na 'di sapat yun kaya kailangan ulitin sa tamang panahon,” he added. (It's better to be vaccinated than not. So even though we know the child may not be protected...the vaccinated child has an advantage compared to the one not vaccinated. But we know that is not enough so the vaccine should be given again at the right time.) In normal conditions, 6 months old is too early for a measles vaccination because maternal antibodies still persist in the baby, rendering the vaccine useless. But during outbreaks, the vaccine is given at 6 months old because, as Tayag said, “nagbabakasakali ka na wala na yung antibodies at kakagat na yung bakuna.” (You're hoping there are no more antibodies and the vaccine will take effect.) Dr Beatriz Quiambao, president of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines, told parents not to worry, as there is no such thing as an overdose when getting more than the prescribed number of vaccines. Tayag again urged parents to avail of the free vaccines, which he said, is the only prevention against measles. And while it is possible to prevent complications, he said people die of measles mainly because they are malnourished or brought to the hospital too late. Last year, the department recorded 21 deaths due to measles.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON DC, USA – US health authorities have linked the Philippines to 288 US measles cases so far this year, the most in two decades, a rise that is driven by unvaccinated people. \"This is the largest number of measles cases in the United States reported in the first 5 months of a year since 1994,\" said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday, May 29, in the US. Nearly all the cases have involved Americans who were not vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, and who traveled abroad and caught the infection in other countries. Then, they \"brought the virus back to the United States and spread to others in communities where many people are not vaccinated,\" said Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Many of the US clusters originated after people traveled to the Philippines, where a large measles outbreak has been ongoing since late 2013. (READ: Amish volunteers to PH brought measles to Ohio – report) “Of the 288 cases, 280 (97%) were associated with importations from at least 18 countries.... Forty-five direct importations (40 US residents returning from abroad and 5 foreign visitors) have been reported. Almost half (22 [49%]) of these importations were travelers returning from the Philippines, where a large outbreak has been occurring since October 2013,” the CDC said. 'Importations' problematic US health authorities noted that in the Philippines, “32,030 measles cases (26,014 suspected cases and 6,016 confirmed cases) and 41 measles deaths have been reported from January 1 through April 20.” (READ: Measles-free Philippines by 2017?) “The large number of importations from the Philippines highlights how importations are related to increases in measles incidence in countries that are common destinations for US travelers,” the CDC said. It added that 90% of all measles cases in the US “were in people who were not vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.” Eighty-five percent of unvaccinated people said they declined the shot for \"religious, philosophical or personal reasons.\" The CDC urged people to get vaccinated against measles, which it described as a \"serious respiratory disease that is highly contagious.\" Symptoms include fever, rash, runny nose, pink eye and cough. Worldwide, an estimated 20 million people get measles and 122,000 die from the disease each year.",

Nage-export na tayo ng (We already export) measle cases, importations to other countries like US, Japan, Australia, Singapore,” Dulce Elfa of the health department’s Family Health Office said at a seminar. For 2014 alone, the DOH already recorded 6,287 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles. (READ: DOH steps up drive vs measles amid outbreak) Elfa said the top 3 regions with the most measle cases are the National Capital Region, Calabarzon and Central Luzon. Most of the cases are unvaccinated children under two years of age. Measles is a viral, highly-contagious respiratory disease. Infected persons exhibit symptoms such as high fever, red eyes, runny nose, and cough. Rashes appear throughout the body after two days. The illness can be spread through cough or direct contact with body secretions of an infected person. A person with measles can pass the disease on to 18 other people. Factors Elfa enumerated 6 main reasons for the outbreak: Variation in subnational coverage for the 1st dose measles vaccination Slow uptake for the MCV2 Large birth cohort of 2.7 million leads to quick accumulation of susceptibles and densely populated in many areas Immunization coverage in 2011 campaign was not high and uniform from area to area Series of major disasters from December 2012 to end of 2013 affected some regions, with significant damage to general infrastructure, health facilities, staff capacities and service implementation Widespread domestic population movements further aggravated by disasters Data from the National Epidemiology Center showed that in 2013, there was a large drop in the percentage of children who completed their two vaccines for protection from measles. From the 91% of children who were administered their first vaccine, only 55% came back for their second vaccine. (READ: DOH: Measles upsurge due to kids missing free vaccination) The health department prescribes that children should get their first measles vaccine at 9 to 11 months old, and their booster shot at 15 months old. As Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag earlier said, the first vaccine is 90% effective, while the booster is 100% effective. As of July 5, the country’s measles incidence rate is at 162 people for every population of 1 million. There are also 16,214 confirmed cases of measles, which include both laboratory-confirmed cases and epidemiologically-linked ones. \"Halos lahat ng regions may outbreak na ng measles (Almost all regions already have an outbreak),” Elfa noted. Health Secretary Enrique Ona earlier explained that a measles outbreak means “there have been cases of a disease – either suspected or confirmed – in a community or a locality where in the past there was none.\" There is also a high number of confirmed cases among children below 9 months old who are not yet eligible for vaccination. DOH is set to conduct a month-long nationwide vaccination in September to interrupt the transmission of measles and rubella, and to protect Filipinos from the consequences of importation of wild poliovirus. (READ: Measles, dengue, and public health) The department’s strategy will be to reach every purok (area) and achieve over 95% coverage. Health service delivery will also be re-established in disaster-hit areas. \"Before the year ends sana makita natin drop [in] cases (Before the year ends we hope to see a drop [in] cases),” Elfa said.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – The recent upsurge of measles cases in certain areas of the country, especially Metro Manila, was due to children missing crucial measles vaccinations at an early age, the health department said on Monday, January 6. The irony is that the vaccines are readily available for free in rural health clinics across the country. Latest figures from government showed that the number of confirmed cases in Metro Manila in 2013 was almost 17 times more than the figure from 2012. Of the 417 cases of measles recorded in the national capital region 2013, Health Secretary Enrique Ona said 88% didn't have any history of vaccination. In a press conference, Ona attributed the increase in measles cases to children missing their preliminary and booster vaccination shots. Babies aged 6 to 11 months should be administered their first vaccine shot. At 12 to 18 months, they should get vaccination a second time. \"There are a good number of parents who, for one reason or another, don't get their child vaccinated,\" said Ona. As an example, he cited certain tribes or religious sectors whose members refuse vaccinations. The Department of Health (DOH) was able to vaccinate only 85% of Filipino children during the last nationwide vaccination program in 2011, he said. \"As you go in the last 3 years, there were a lot of children who missed the vaccinations, making them suscepticle to measles,\" Ona continued. \"The point is, there should have been no more measles in Metro Manila, or even in the whole Philippines, but that has not happened yet. The Philippines is not yet measles-free,\" said Ona. The DOH is slated to conduct another nationwide vaccination drive this year. Extent of the outbreak Ona said that the DOH is aware of the measles outbreak in certain areas of the country, and is closely coordinating with local health officials to address the matter. \"Yes, there have been an increase in reports in some areas in Metro Manila. We are aware of it. We are monitoring it very closely,\" said Ona. Ona then clarified to media the definition of an outbreak. \"It means that there have been cases of a disease – either suspected or confirmed – in a community or a locality where in the past there was none.\" Even a single case, if it is the first ever in area, is considered an outbreak, he said. There were a total of 1,724 measles cases reported nationwide, from Jan 1 to Dec 14, 2013, with 21 deaths. Latest figures in the National Capital Region (NCR) from the DOH Center for Health Development (CHD) show that there have been 417 confirmed measles cases, including 3 deaths, logged in 2013. In 2012, only 25 cases were reported in NCR. Children between one and 4 years old were affected the most, consisting 38% of the cases. Las Piñas City reported the most number of measles cases with 78, followed by Manila (72), Muntinlupa City (65), Caloocan City (45), and Parañaque City (32). The DOH report also noted that 88% of the measles cases in the NCR in 2013 had no history of previous measles vaccination. Ona said that all cities in Metro Manila have been actively expanding their vaccination drives since September 2013, when most measles cases started rising drastically. \"As a matter of fact, in December 2013 in the city of Manila, there was a 28% decrease in suspected measles cases. In Caloocan City, there were no suspected cases in November and December,\" said Ona. \"There is no reason to be scared, or to be too concerned. However, it is imperative that the parents take a good look at their children always, so that when symptoms of measles appear, the child should be brought to the hospital or health center,\" Ona added. When asked if adults can also avail themselves of measles vaccines, Ona said that they could, but the children are top priority.",

    "timestamp": "09:11 AM March 29, 2017",
    "content": "STOCKHOLM, Sweden — The World Health Organization (WHO) warned Tuesday of large measles outbreaks in countries where immunization has dropped, after more than 500 cases of the highly contagious disease were reported across Europe in January. “With steady progress towards elimination over the past two years, it is of particular concern that measles cases are climbing in Europe,” the agency’s regional director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said in a statement. “Today’s travel patterns put no person or country beyond the reach of the measles virus,” she said. The respiratory disease, characterized by high fever and small red spots, usually triggers only mild symptoms, but it remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. Severe complications can occur, however, leading to miscarriage in pregnant women, brain swelling or the risk of death by pneumonia. The virus is spread by coughing and sneezing, and by close contact with infected individuals. France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Poland, Switzerland and Ukraine were the most affected, accounting for 474 of the 559 cases reported for January. In these countries, national vaccination levels against the virus are below the 95 percent threshold considered necessary for protecting the entire population. Preliminary figures for February indicate that the number of new infections is rising sharply, the WHO said. The figures cover the agency’s entire European region, covering 53 countries including Israel, Kazakhstan and Russia. “I urge all endemic countries to take urgent measures to stop transmission of measles within their borders, and all countries that have already achieved this to keep up their guard and sustain high immunization coverage,” Jakab said. “Outbreaks will continue in Europe, as elsewhere, until every country reaches the level of immunization needed to fully protect their populations,” she added. Currently, the largest outbreaks are occurring in Italy and Romania. The number of measles cases in Italy has tripled this year, largely because parents are not getting children vaccinated because of fears of a link between the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination shot and autism, the health ministry said last week. Several major studies, however, have shown no evidence of such a link. In Romania, a measles outbreak has killed 17 children and infected thousands more since September, the result of both poverty and an anti-vaccination movement, local media reported Saturday. In poor countries, many people do not have access to the $1 vaccine (94 euro cents), but the WHO has pointed out that children in affluent countries have a greater risk of infection because of skepticism about immunization.",

Health Assistant Secretary Dr. Eric Tayag, who is also director of the National Epidemiology Center, said that from Jan. 1 to Dec. 14, 2013, there were already 1,724 confirmed measles cases nationwide, 21 of which led to death. He added that among the 17 regions in the country, only four did not report an increase in the number of measles cases. These are Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao and the Caraga region in Mindanao. The National Capital Region had the most number of cases with 744. Measles outbreak had been declared in the following Metro Manila areas: Quiapo, Sampaloc, Tondo, Binondo, Sta. Cruz, Port Area and Sta. Mesa in Manila; Dagat-dagatan and Bagong Barrio, in Caloocan City; Talon 5, Talon 2 and Pamplona Uno in Las Piñas; Longos and Tonsuya in Malabon; Alabang and Putatan in Muntinlupa; North Bay Boulevard South in Navotas; Moonwalk and Don Bosco in Parañaque; Bagong Tanyag in Taguig; and Ugong in Valenzuela. But Tayag noted that mass vaccinations had already been conducted in those places. He said mass vaccinations would also soon be conducted nationwide, preferably during the summer break. He urged parents to bring their children, especially those between the ages of 6 to 18 months, to health centers for free vaccination. Tayag noted that measles is a contagious viral illness, which can be deadly. He said it commonly spreads among children and even adults, but the most susceptible are children 10 years old and below. He said infants and children with measles should be hospitalized. Children 6 to 18 months old must complete the required two vaccinations to prevent them from contracting measles, he said. Newborn children must take the first preventive vaccine shot for measles upon reaching 6 months to 12 months. The second vaccine shot should be taken upon reaching the age of 12 months to 18 months. “These two consecutive shots must be taken to avoid having the risk of getting measles,” he said. He said measles usually begins with common cold symptoms like high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes that can last for several days before the appearance of a red, blotchy rash. Tayag suggested that parents bring down the fever with paracetamol and sponge bath to prevent the onset of convulsions, and to get rid of the thick discharges from the nose. He also urged parents to count a child’s inhalations, noting a child less than five years old with more than 40 breaths per minute may have pneumonia.",

    "timestamp": "06:36 PM January 14, 2014",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines—The Philippine Health Insurance announced Tuesday that patients hospitalized due to measles may avail themselves of PhilHealth benefits. In a news forum, PhilHealth president and CEO Alexander Padilla said that patients confined even due to simple measles cases are now covered by PhilHealth following the outbreak of the disease in many parts of the country. According to him, measles was previously removed from its list of benefits because there had been almost no hospital admissions due to simple measles. “But those with complications due to measles such as pneumonia, dehydration and encephalitis have been continuously covered by PhilHealth,” he said. “Since there is an outbreak of the disease, we decided to revive this month the simple measles case rate package, but it has to involve hospital confinement,” added PhilHealth spokesperson Dr. Israel Francis Pargas. Pargas said patients will be covered for P7,000 and up to P32,000 if it involves complications from the disease. He added that the coverage will be implemented retroactively, which means those who were admitted even from January 1 to 14 can file for PhilHealth claims. Meanwhile, almost 800 suspected cases of measles have been reported in Metro Manila for the first 11 days of the month, according to the Department of Health. Based on the DOH-National Capital report, there were 760 suspected cases reported from January 1 to 11, 2014 compared with only 10 cases during the same period last year. Most (272) cases were in Manila City, followed by Parañaque City with 138 cases. Other cities with significant increase in cases were Quezon, Taguig, Navotas and Las Piñas. The DOH report said clustering of suspected measles cases has been noted in the cities of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Manila, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, Quezon, Taguig, and Valenzuela. Three deaths from suspect measles cases were also reported during the period, the report added. Thirty-nine percent of those affected belonged to the 1-4 years age-group, the DOH report said, adding that 9 percent or 67 victims had history of previous measles vaccination. A total of 1,724 cases of measles have been reported from Jan. 1 to Dec, 14, 2013 nationwide, including 21 deaths. The DOH is to launch in September a nationwide mass vaccination campaign to eliminate measles in the country.",

    "content": "KARACHI–More than 300 Pakistani children died of measles last year, a staggering increase on the previous 12 months and a result of three consecutive years of flooding, officials said Tuesday. The United Nations’ World Health Organization said 306 children died of the highly infectious illness last year, 210 of them in the southern province of Sindh, where the worst floods occurred in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The WHO said 64 children died of measles in Pakistan in 2011, 28 of them in Sindh. It was not immediately able to provide statistics for earlier years. “Most of the affected children died due to post-measles complications such as pneumonia, post-measles encephalitis and diarrhea,” said WHO spokeswoman Maryam Yunus. The UN body said most of the cases occurred between October and December in northern districts of Sindh, but was unable to provide a breakdown. “Most of (the) children who have died because of suspected measles are reported from the districts affected by the floods for (the) last three years,” said Yunus. She said WHO investigations had shown that malnourishment was a major reason for such a high number of deaths of children in Sindh. “Floods, displacements and food shortages have played a major role behind these deaths,” she added. A Pakistani health ministry official said more than half the deaths in Sindh occurred in the last three months of the year, with 50 children dying in December alone.The official, who did not wish to be named, told AFP that the number of deaths in 2012 was “a record high”. Pakistan on December 31 started a new measles vaccination drive in the worst affected areas, which will run until January 9, officials said. Children under nine months are not eligible for the vaccine.",

    "content": "(Updated 2:10 p.m., Jan. 6) The Department of Health declared measles outbreaks in five cities in Metro Manila Saturday as the number of patients infected by the viral disease continues to rise. The World Health Organization (WHO) said an outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season. It said an outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extend over several countries. It may also last for a few days or weeks, or for several years. The cities where outbreaks have been declared are: Caloocan Dagat-dagatan Bagong Barrio Las Piñas Talon Singko Talon Dos Manila Quiapo Port Area Sta. Mesa Binondo Sta. Cruz Muntinlupa Alabang Parañaque According to a report aired on “Balitanghali” Saturday, the DOH has recorded 744 confirmed cases of measles in Metro Manila alone between January 1 to December 14, 2013. A total of 1,724 measles cases, meanwhile, have been reported across the country, 21 of which led to death. In posts on his Twitter account, National Epidemiology Center head Dr. Enrique Tayag appealed to parents Thursday to bring their children to health centers for free vaccination. Measles vaccination is free in health centers nationwide, he said. Last December, DOH said local health officials started to seek vulnerable children aged 0 to 59 months in their areas to vaccinate them against the disease. Although measles is a viral disease that commonly infects children, Tayag said it can also affect adults because it is highly contagious.  The symptoms of measles are redness of the eyes, coughs and colds, fever reaching 40 degrees Celsius, and rashes on the ears, face, neck, and the whole body. Tayag said the patient may also have difficulty in breathing. In a text message to GMA News Online on Sunday, Tayag clarified that “outbreaks and epidemics are one and the same thing. They occur when more than the usual number of expected cases occur in a particular area. For measles, outbreaks or epidemics occur when many susceptible persons get sick.” “One is susceptible if you were unvaccinated and you have not had measles before,” he added. Earlier on Sunday, Tayag also said the Health Department will seek the help of health officers and civil society in stepping up its efforts against measles. He said DOH officials will meet with local officials on Monday.",

According to the latest statistics, measles cases reached 1,724 from January 1 to December 14, 2013. Of the number, 21 patients died. “There are outbreaks last year and it is going on right now” Tayag in an interview with Inquirer Radio 990AM. Tayag said the measles outbreak, which started last year, would linger until summer. “That’s when the measles will peak (summer) and we hope we can contain it so we can reduce the number of children getting sick and even adults because measles spread easily because it is airborne.” Tayag, known for his dance moves to campaign for crucial health programs, said the local government units are in charge of the vaccination of children in their areas. The Health Department only supplies the vaccines. “The local government’s primary responsibility is to make sure that the vaccines the Department of Health buys and distributes to them are actually used,” he said. According to Tayag, measles vaccines should be administered twice – first when a child is nine to 11 months old and another when the child is 12-months-old to 18 months-old. He added that if mothers or relatives would not bring the children to the health centers, DOH personnel would come personally to the houses to administer the measles vaccine.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – Two weeks after the Department of Health (DOH) launched its month-long mass immunization campaign, only 44% of the target number of children had received vaccines for measles-rubella and oral polio.\nIn a press conference Thursday, September 18, Health Undersecretary Janette Garin said the department’s target is to reach 50% by 2nd week of September.\n\"We need a more aggressive campaign now na nasimulan na natin. Being on [its] 2nd week, supposedly nasa 50% na ang nareach [ng campaign],” she explained.\n(We need a more aggressive campaign now that we already started it. Being on [its] 2nd week, supposedly the campaign already reached 50%.)\nThere are several reasons why DOH did not hit the target, Garin said. Some areas started the campaign late, while some are still recovering from disasters.\nThere are also areas which lacked preparation. In the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), for example, DOH had to sort through issues of logistical support.\n\"Hindi basta-basta puwedeng ibaba kung 'di mo ma-assure na yung pondo ay mapupunta sa pagpapabakuna,\" she said, adding that the funds from the Central Office are only supplementary to funds of the local government.\n(You can't just make fund releases if you can't be sure they will really go to vaccination.)\nMeasles is a viral, highly-contagious respiratory disease. Infected persons exhibit symptoms such as high fever, red eyes, runny nose, and cough. Rashes appear throughout the body after two days.\nThe illness can be spread through cough or direct contact with body secretions of an infected person. A person with measles can pass the disease on to 18 other people.\nFrom January 1 to August 9, 2014, the DOH recorded 48,779 suspected cases of measles. Out of this number, 16,743 are confirmed cases.\nParticipation of provinces, cities\nGarin praised the provinces and cities with the highest immunization rates:\nTop performing provinces\nTop performing cities\nIn the National Capital Region, the top performing cities for measles-rubella immunization (47% to 62%) are San Juan, Navotas, Caloocan, Las Piñas, and Valenzuela. For the oral polio vaccine, the top performing cities (47% to 60%) are San Juan, Las Piñas, Caloocan, Navotas, and Pateros.\nBut the areas below have some catching up to do:\nLow performing areas for measles-rubella and oral polio immunization\nGarin said the fight of the country against measles will be \"useless\" if not everyone will cooperate. She urged local government units to help reach children in their locality.\nThe campaign aims to achieve at least 95% vaccination coverage at all administrative levels. (READ: Measles-free Philippines by 2017?)\nThe target covers children who received their vaccination from health centers, barangay health stations, local churches, and other designated vaccination posts.\n\"Sayang naman kung patuloy nating papayagan yung isang sakit na manatili sa bansa natin [kung] meron naman tayong pera at kakayanan para sugpuin ito,\" she said.\n(It’s a shame if we will let a disease affect our country when we have the resources and the capability to fight it.)\nShe added: \"Mahirap kung maraming missed children from 0-5 [years old] dahil sila [ang] source ng infection (It’s hard to have a lot of missed chldren from 0-5 years old because they can be the source of the infection).\"\nSustain awareness\nDOH is deploying rapid coverage assessment teams in areas with low immunization rates. If the teams find at least 2 unvaccinated children, it means the area has not yet been fully covered by the campaign.\nIf the teams find no unvaccinated children, the department will declare the area fully-covered, since the actual number of children is different from the estimated target.\nGarin said there is a need to sustain the awareness on the importance of immunization to reach the 95% target. After all, some of the complications of measles are permanent, like blindness. The disease can also be deadly.\n\"Nung una very maingay [yung campaign]. Ang bilis makalimutan. Kailangan pa ng dagdag na ingay. It’s not the cost, it’s the lives that we can save,\" she added.\n(There was a lot of noise at the start of the campaign. People are quick to forget. We need to make some more noise. It’s not the cost, it’s the lives that we can save.)\nDespite missing its initial target, Garin hopes the health department will still reach the 95% target, so that the campaign would not have to be extended.\n\"If we extend, the more difficult it will be to fight it. But as the need arises, we will make a decision,\" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.\nThe Philippines, which “exported” measles to other countries, hopes to eliminate measles by 2017.",

    "timestamp": "January 06, 2014 9:56 PM",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – The recent upsurge of measles cases in certain areas of the country, especially Metro Manila, was due to children missing crucial measles vaccinations at an early age, the health department said on Monday, January 6.\nThe irony is that the vaccines are readily available for free in rural health clinics across the country.\nLatest figures from government showed that the number of confirmed cases in Metro Manila in 2013 was almost 17 times more than the figure from 2012.\nOf the 417 cases of measles recorded in the national capital region 2013, Health Secretary Enrique Ona said 88% didn't have any history of vaccination.\nIn a press conference, Ona attributed the increase in measles cases to children missing their preliminary and booster vaccination shots. Babies aged 6 to 11 months should be administered their first vaccine shot. At 12 to 18 months, they should get vaccination a second time.\n\"There are a good number of parents who, for one reason or another, don't get their child vaccinated,\" said Ona. As an example, he cited certain tribes or religious sectors whose members refuse vaccinations.\nThe Department of Health (DOH) was able to vaccinate only 85% of Filipino children during the last nationwide vaccination program in 2011, he said.\n\"As you go in the last 3 years, there were a lot of children who missed the vaccinations, making them suscepticle to measles,\" Ona continued.\n\"The point is, there should have been no more measles in Metro Manila, or even in the whole Philippines, but that has not happened yet. The Philippines is not yet measles-free,\" said Ona.\nThe DOH is slated to conduct another nationwide vaccination drive this year.\nExtent of the outbreak\nOna said that the DOH is aware of the measles outbreak in certain areas of the country, and is closely coordinating with local health officials to address the matter.\n\"Yes, there have been an increase in reports in some areas in Metro Manila. We are aware of it. We are monitoring it very closely,\" said Ona.\nOna then clarified to media the definition of an outbreak. \"It means that there have been cases of a disease – either suspected or confirmed – in a community or a locality where in the past there was none.\"\nEven a single case, if it is the first ever in area, is considered an outbreak, he said.\nThere were a total of 1,724 measles cases reported nationwide, from Jan 1 to Dec 14, 2013, with 21 deaths.\nLatest figures in the National Capital Region (NCR) from the DOH Center for Health Development (CHD) show that there have been 417 confirmed measles cases, including 3 deaths, logged in 2013. In 2012, only 25 cases were reported in NCR.\nChildren between one and 4 years old were affected the most, consisting 38% of the cases.\nLas Piñas City reported the most number of measles cases with 78, followed by Manila (72), Muntinlupa City (65), Caloocan City (45), and Parañaque City (32).\nThe DOH report also noted that 88% of the measles cases in the NCR in 2013 had no history of previous measles vaccination.\nOna said that all cities in Metro Manila have been actively expanding their vaccination drives since September 2013, when most measles cases started rising drastically.\n\"As a matter of fact, in December 2013 in the city of Manila, there was a 28% decrease in suspected measles cases. In Caloocan City, there were no suspected cases in November and December,\" said Ona.\n\"There is no reason to be scared, or to be too concerned. However, it is imperative that the parents take a good look at their children always, so that when symptoms of measles appear, the child should be brought to the hospital or health center,\" Ona added.\nWhen asked if adults can also avail themselves of measles vaccines, Ona said that they could, but the children are top priority.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON DC, USA – US President Barack Obama and American health authorities appealed to the public to vaccinate their children as the country faces an outbreak of measles due to some parents believing vaccines against deadly diseases are dangerous.\nConsidered eradicated from the US in 2000, measles re-emerged in December in an outbreak clustered around the Disneyland amusement park in California.\nSince then, 102 cases of measles have been reported in 14 states according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\"We are very concerned by the growing number of people who are susceptible to measles and the possibility that we could have a large outbreak in this country as a result,\" head of the CDC Tom Frieden said over the weekend while encouraging parents to vaccinate their children.\nMeasles causes fever and rash and in severe cases can lead to pneumonia or brain swelling. The disease is highly contagious because it is transmitted through the air.\nThe United States had 644 cases of measles in 2014, a record number since 2000. There were 173 cases in 2013.\nThe resurgence of the disease in the US coincides with a movement of some parents refusing to vaccinate their children.\nMany people who don't vaccinate their children say they fear a triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is responsible for increasing cases of autism – a theory repeatedly disproven by various studies.\nOther people refuse vaccination on religious or political grounds.\nThe controversy dates back to the publication of a now debunked article in the Lancet medical journal in 1998. The media has been heavily criticized for republishing information in the report that was withdrawn in 2010.\nBeliefs unfounded\nNumerous scientific studies have clearly shown there is no link between vaccines and autism or other health risks.\nIn 2014, the parents of 79% of unvaccinated children asked authorities of their state to be exempt from immunization on the basis of their beliefs, said Anne Schuchat, head of immunization at the CDC.\nPresident Obama tried to convince skeptical parents to ignore unfounded beliefs about vaccines as concerns over the outbreak grow.\n\"I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned about the effect of vaccinations. The science is, you know, pretty indisputable. We have looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there are not reasons to not,\" Obama said Sunday, February 1.\nThe issue of vaccinations has stirred up the country's political scene, particularly among potential Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential election.\nThe issue presents challenges for the politicians who do not want to alienate the ultra-conservative electorate who sometimes reject the vaccine.\nWhen asked about the issue, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a moderate Republican, said it was important for parents to have \"some measure of choice.\" His press office later issued a statement saying children should be vaccinated for the disease.\n\"While I think it's a good idea to take the vaccine, I think that is a personal decision for individuals,\" said Senator Rand Paul, a doctor and leader among the Tea Party, a more conservative movement.\nOn the other hand, Speaker of the House or Representatives, Republican John Boehner was very clear on the issue: \"I do believe that all children ought to be vaccinated.\"\nThe same message was echoed by Republican Senator Marco Rubio: \"There is absolutely no medical science or data whatsoever that links those vaccinations to onset of autism or anything of that nature,\" he said.\n\"So absolutely, all children in American should be vaccinated.\"",

Infection usually begins with a fever followed by a cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a rash.\nComplications can include blindness, hearing loss, pneumonia and death. One to two children of every 1,000 infected with measles will die from it, the CDC said.\nEradication means the disease is no longer native to the United States, but there were 644 measles cases in the US last year, an enormous jump from 173 cases in 2013.\nAn analysis by the Los Angeles Times last year found that 9.5% of kindergarten children in an Orange County school district were exempted from vaccinations because of personal beliefs.",

    "content": "HANOI, Vietnam – Vietnam is scrambling to contain a deadly outbreak of measles that has killed more than 100 people, mostly young children, and infected thousands more this year, the government said Friday, April 18.\nAt least 112 people – the majority of them under 10 years old – have died of the disease so far in 2014, the Ministry of Health said in a statement.\nIt warned that the number of deaths could rise because of cross infections, bad weather and overcrowding at pediatrics hospitals in major cities where panicked parents are bringing their infected children.\nVietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung on Wednesday called for authorities to be more \"active\" in preventing the spread of the disease.\nThe authorities are providing vaccines, stepping up surveillance of the disease and urging parents to seek treatment locally instead of at pediatric hospitals whose patients are vulnerable to infection.\nWorld Health Organization representative Takeshi Kasai said he was \"very concerned\" about the outbreak.\n\"This virus is very infectious and difficult to control,\" he told the Agence France-Presse (AFP), adding that the best way to contain the disease was to encourage people to be vaccinated.\nVietnam has high rates of vaccinations for many early childhood diseases including measles, but may be falling victim to its own success as some parents – particularly those who have read scare stories about vaccination side effects – see less risk from leaving their children uninoculated. (READ: DOH: PH measles upsurge due to kids missing free vaccination)\nNguyen Hoa Lan, 38, said both her son and daughter – aged 10 and 7 – have become infected with measles in the last week.\n\"I am worried as I only vaccinated my daughter once... I forgot the second vaccination. But also because of scandals and rumor with the vaccination, I decided to skip it. Now it makes me worried,\" she told AFP.\n\"I can only pray that things will be ok.\"\nMeasles, a highly contagious viral disease which is particularly deadly for young children, claimed some 122,000 lives globally in 2012, the most recent year for which global figures are available, according to the WHO.\nBack in 2000, the toll was a stark 562,000.\nThe measles vaccination is not particularly effective for children under nine months, the WHO said, so societies need to ensure high rates of vaccination among older children to boost overall immunity of the population.",

It may also last for a few days or weeks, or for several years.\nThe cities where outbreaks have been declared are:\nCaloocan\nDagat-dagatan\nBagong Barrio\nLas Piñas\nTalon Singko\nTalon Dos\nManila\nQuiapo\nPort Area\nSta.

A total of 1,724 measles cases, meanwhile, have been reported across the country, 21 of which led to death.\nIn posts on his Twitter account, National Epidemiology Center head Dr. Enrique Tayag appealed to parents Thursday to bring their children to health centers for free vaccination.\nMeasles vaccination is free in health centers nationwide, he said.\nLast December, DOH said local health officials started to seek vulnerable children aged 0 to 59 months in their areas to vaccinate them against the disease.\nAlthough measles is a viral disease that commonly infects children, Tayag said it can also affect adults because it is highly contagious. \nThe symptoms of measles are redness of the eyes, coughs and colds, fever reaching 40 degrees Celsius, and rashes on the ears, face, neck, and the whole body.\nTayag said the patient may also have difficulty in breathing.\nIn a text message to GMA News Online on Sunday, Tayag clarified that \noutbreaks and epidemics are one and the same thing. They occur when more than the usual number of expected cases occur in a particular area. For measles, outbreaks or epidemics occur when many susceptible persons get sick.\n\n\nOne is susceptible if you were unvaccinated and you have not had measles before,\n he added.\nEarlier on Sunday, Tayag also said the Health Department will seek the help of health officers and civil society in stepping up its efforts against measles.\nHe said DOH officials will meet with local officials on Monday.",

By December 14, the Department of Health had tallied 1,724 measles cases across the country, 21 of which led to death.\n\"The increase in the number of measles patients has forced us to convert sections of San Lazaro Hospital into measles ward,\" Villarama said.\nAt least 75 have died of the disease in 2013, according to a report on \"24 Oras\" aired Friday evening that quoted Villarama. \"Usually, ito ay mga complicated na measles with pneumonia,\" he said.\nAs he led reporters on a tour of the hospital’s Pavilion 4, which houses 96 measles patients, Villarama disclosed two measles patients now occupy one hospital bed.\nThree pavilions in the hospital were converted to measles wards, the report said.\nVillarama said as soon as a measles patient shows signs of dehydration or difficulty in breathing, the patient must be rushed to the nearest hospital for medical attention.\nThe \"24 Oras\" report showed most of the patients were babies and children. One of the patient was three months old, puzzling even Health Assistant Secretary Enrique Tayag who said the common age for measles patients is six months.\nOutside, dozens more wait for their turn to be admitted to the hospital full of patients, the report said.\nIn a separate press conference, Tayag said the National Capital Region reported the highest number of measles cases, registering 744 out of the 1,724 cases. In 2012, the DOH listed 1,536 measles cases.\nSouthern Luzon with 436 cases and Western Visayas with 282 complete the top three regions hardest hit by measles, Tayag said. Of the country’s 17 regions, only Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao, and Caraga regions had no reports of increased measles cases.\nTayag urged local government units and health centers nationwide to administer vaccines against measles daily, if possible.\n\"You cannot escape measles... Lagnat pa lang, pwede nang makahawa ang isang bata, hindi pa lumalabas 'yung pantal,\" he said.\nTayag added one may have measles without prior vaccination or exposure to the virus. He said the ideal age for children to be vaccinated is from nine months to one year old and from 15 months to 18 months old.\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services says a second dose of the vaccine must be given when a child is 4 to 6 years old.\nThe symptoms of measles are redness of the eyes, coughs and colds, fever reaching 40 degrees Celsius, and rashes on the ears, face, neck, and the whole body. Tayag said the patient may also have difficulty in breathing.\nThe outbreak of the measles virus is recorded in the following areas:\nCaloocan - Dagat-dagatan, Bagong Barrio\nLas Piñas - Talon Singko, Talon Dos\nManila - Quiapo, Sampaloc, Tondo, Santa Cruz, Port Area, Santa Mesa, Binondo\nMuntinlupa - Alabang\nParañaque\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted through droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.\nThe WHO said there is no specific treatment for measles and recovery may take two to three weeks. But complications of measles in malnourished children may result in blindness, diarrhea, pneumonia, encephalitis and ear infection.",

The number of cases was observed to have started piling up last February 22. Of the 400 reported cases, 31 were confined in hospitals in Tuburan, a coastal town located north of Cebu City.\nDepartment of Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said the department is eyeing \"contaminated water\" as the cause of the outbreak. He said, however, that it is not clear yet whether the contaminated water came from pipelines or deep wells, the two sources of residents for their water.\nTayag said the health department has already dispatched teams to look into the outbreak. Meantime, he advised residents of the affected areas to boil or disinfect water, while health officials are waiting for lab results on the water tests.\nTayag said antibiotics were already distributed to those requiring treatment. This is to prevent deaths due to intestinal hemorrhage or severe bacterial infection.\nPotentially fatal disease\nTyphoid fever is a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi.\nA person can get it from food or drink contaminated by the feces or urine of infected people.\nTyphoid symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. Symptoms include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhea, rose-colored spots on the chest, and an enlarged spleen and liver.\nEven after symptoms go away, those afflicted may still be carrying Salmonella Typhi, according to information published by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThis means the illness could return, or the person previously afflicted could pass the disease to other people.\nHow to avoid typhoid\nThe CDC lists down the following tips to avoid typhoid:\n\nIf you drink water, buy it bottled or bring it to a rolling boil for 1 minute before you drink it.\nAsk for drinks without ice--unless the ice is made from bottled or boiled water. Avoid popsicles and flavored ices that may have been made with contaminated water.\nEat foods that have been thoroughly cooked and that are still hot and steaming.\nAvoid raw vegetables and fruits that cannot be peeled. Vegetables like lettuce are easily contaminated and are very hard to wash well.\nWhen you eat raw fruit or vegetables that can be peeled, peel them yourself. (Wash your hands with soap first.) Do not eat the peelings.\nAvoid foods and beverages from street vendors. It is difficult for food to be kept clean on the street, and many travelers get sick from food bought from street vendors.",

Residents were likewise advised to boil their water before consuming them.\nIn his visit to Calamba City, Duque also met with Dr Eric Tayag of the DOH National Epidemiology Center, Calamba Mayor Joaquin Chipeco, and other city health officials.\nAs of Sunday, a total of 732 residents have been hospitalized after showing symptoms of the disease while 1,272 more have visited community health centers to have themselves checked, Labro said.\nThe DOH said that while the number of people ushed to the hospital have declined, they are not about to declare that they have the outbreak contained, adding that they will continue monitoring the situation until the week's end.\nAlthough more than two thousand residents have already been affected by the outbreak, city health officials maintained that no confirmed deaths from typhoid fever has been reported yet.\nOfficials refused to confirm two previous deaths, including a 14-year-old girl, as being connected to typhoid since both have not undergone screening tests and autopsies.\nLabro however said they are still further studying the case of the 14-year-old girl, whose parents have refused to have her subjected to an autopsy.\nBut Labro said they would still undertake \"other investigations short of having autopsy.\"\nFor his part, Sen. Richard Gordon, who is the Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC) chairman, slammed the government's sluggish actions in determining the root of the widespread health problem.\n\"Where did this originate? In water pipelines? Many people in 18 villages are affected and the government should come out and tell us this comes from this place, so that we can stop the outbreak,\" Gordon told GMA News in Filipino.\nThe PNRC has been assisting local health officials in attending to hospitalized residents by providing free medicines, tents, and beds.\nLabro said that health officials were not immediately able to release confirmation of the water contamination since early water samples obtained from various sources tested negative for any bacteria.",
