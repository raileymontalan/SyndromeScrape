----Instructions----

1) Open your JSON file.
2) Copy the entire string value of the "content" key.
3) Open http://pojo.sodhanalibrary.com/lineCharPosition.html in your browser.
4) In the page, paste the entire string (without the surrounding double quotes) to the text box.
    e.g. PASTE(This is a paragraph), not PASTE("This is a paragraph")
5) Start identifying relevant words and their appropriate tags.
    'GPE'       -> geopolitical entities like "Isabela", "Quezon City", and "Calabarzon"
    'LOC_TYPE'  -> non-pronoun locations like "province", "the country", "barangay"
    'ORG'       -> organizations like "DOH", "provincial health office"
    'DATE'      -> dates like "this week", "Nov. 6", "from January to July last year"
    'CARDINAL'  -> cardinal numbers like "2,000", "three", "less than 50"
    'PERCENT'   -> percentages like "20.5%", "two percent"
    'DISEASE'   -> disease-words like "typhoid", "dengue", "mosquito-borne disease", "measles-like"
    'CASE'      -> disease incidents like "incident", "case", "number" e.g. "The >>number<< of dengue cases increased"
    'STATE'     -> status of disease over a given area like "state of calamity", "hotspots", "outbreak"
    'CHANGE'    -> trends in disease over time like "increased", "dropped" e.g. "Dengue cases >>decreased<< compared to last year"
6) Once you have located the words, use the website to figure out its start and end indexes of the characters of the entities
    e.g. In "ISABELA, Philippines – The..."
    "Isabela" starts at index 0, ends at index 7, and should be tagged as 'GPE'. Apply the same to "Philippines".
    > [(0, 7, 'GPE'), (9, 20, 'GPE')]
7) Take note, in the website, the start character "I" in "ISABELA, Philippines – The..." is shown to be at index 1 instead of 0.
    Given this, subtract 1 from the position of the START character (DO NOT do the same for the END character).
8) Create the list of tuples for all the identified entities within the provided documents. Afterwards, place them in the JSON file.


----How to Submit Work----

DO NOT PUSH TO THE BRANCH. Instead, send a pull request.

If you know how to do this via Source Tree (or whatever software you use), or if you can Google it yourself, ignore the terminal commands in the list.

If you are using the terminal, type out the given commands per step:

1) Create a new branch named after your surname (must be a copy of manual_tagging branch). Switch to this branch.

    > git checkout -b [surname] manual_tagging

3) Add your changes and commit them.

    > git add .
    > git commit -m "[Your message here]"

4) Rebase and push your changes TO YOUR BRANCH. Not to manual_tagging, or to master.

    > git rebase manual_tagging
    > git push origin [name of branch]

5) Go to github.com/raileymontalan/SyndromeScrape.
