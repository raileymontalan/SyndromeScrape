    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – Among countries in the Western Pacific, incidence of dengue was highest in the Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Australia in recent years. This was according to a report on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) released by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday, February 19, which pegged the investment cost of global vector control at $510 million annually. The region reported 348,452 dengue cases in 2012 alone, including 1,199 deaths as the disease has a case-fatality rate of 0.30%. Dengue, a disease common in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito. Dengue fever is potentially fatal and mainly affects children. WHO said dengue is a “disease of the future“ because of “increased urbanization, scarce water supplies, and, possibly, environmental and climate change.“ NTDs, meanwhile, are infections caused by a variety of pathogens that affect more than 1 billion people worldwide. These diseases are endemic in 149 countries, according to WHO. Part of the proposed Sustainable Development Goals is to end NTDs like dengue by 2030. To do this, WHO urged countries to invest billions of dollars to combat the diseases. Invest to fight dengue In the report, WHO said island nations in the Western Pacific such as Fiji are susceptible to dengue epidemics. Malaysia and Singapore also reported a sustained epidemic activity from 2013 to 2014. “Diagnosis and management remain a challenge, with all efforts now focused on vector control with active community involvement,“ the report said of dengue in the region. To sustain vector control worldwide, WHO said the needed investment target is an average of $510 million per year from 2015 to 2030. The figure may continue to increase in the context of climate change. And while a dengue vaccine is already in the works, the UN health agency said its introduction may only “re-program“ some of the investment in vector control towards immunization. Vector control is still cost-effective to combat dengue. “Investments in vector control should therefore be seen as complementary to the development and implementation of a future dengue prevention and control strategy. As the disease continues to expand to newer areas, vector control alone can prevent and reduce outbreaks,“ the report said. In the Philippines, a dengue vaccine tested in the country and 4 other Asian countries showed promising overall efficacy and will be available in the health department’s vaccine program by July 2015. Challenges ahead Although dengue and chikungunya “continue to spread at an alarming pace,“ WHO said significant progress has been made against these diseases. “Trends indicate declining mortality [due to dengue], but morbidity has continued to increase, due partly to better reporting systems,“ the report said. To reduce the burden of dengue, vector control must complement with other measures such as effective surveillance, prevention, and outbreak response.Challenges in the next 15 years include: shortage of trained health workers absence of integrated vector-control programs degree of readiness in some countries to implement WHO-recommended integrated programs comprehensively “Control of dengue is technically feasible with coordinated international technical and financial support for national programmes, and has proven effective in reducing the global burden of malaria,“ WHO said.",

    "content": "BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The onset of rainy season caused the increase of dengue cases in all 6 provinces of the Cordillera Administrative Region and the city of Baguio, the Department of Health said. Dengue surveillance report from January to August this 2015 showed a 103% increase in dengue cases in the region – or 2,383 dengue suspects compared to 1,176 for the same period last year. At least 3 fatalities were reported this year compared to two deaths in 2014 due to dengue. The fatalities include: An 85-year-old male from Luna, Apayao, with a final diagnosis of dengue shock syndrom A 7-year-old from Rosario, La Unio An 89-year-old male from Cervantes, Ilocos Sur JE: Another mosquito-borne disease As dengue cases continue to increase in the Cordillera, the health department is likewise wary of a possible case of Japanese encephalitis (JE), another serious disease caused by mosquito that the public should be aware of. DOH Regional Director Amelita Pangilinan recently told reporters that the health agency have fielded workers to gather samples of mosquitos for laboratory tests in an aim to detect possible JE presence. She explained that JE is caused by mosquitoes (Culex species) infected with the JE virus. Like dengue and chikungunya, JE still has no treatment. According to Pangilinan, JE was first recognized in the late 1800s in Japan and has since spread across East and Southeast Asia, becoming a leading cause of childhood viral encephalitis. Eradicating the breeding sites of mosquitos, Pangilinan explained, is important and easy. Disposing stagnant water should be effortless, she said. Elsewhere, in July, a dengue outbreak was declared in Tuguegarao City in Cagayan province in the northern Philippines. The month before that, the town of Luna in Isabela province, in the same northern region, was put under state of calamity due to dengue. The province of Negros Occidental also reported that as of mid-August, the cases of dengue had increased by 80.84% compared to the first 8 months of last year. A total of 774 dengue patients were admitted to different private and public hospitals from January 1 to August 15 this year, the provincial health office said.",

According to the Department of Health (DOH), at least 14 people have already died from dengue in Cebu province from January to May 2016. The number of cases of dengue have also risen to 1,594 in those 5 months.\nToledo City recorded the highest number of cases with 222 dengue fever cases and 1 death, followed by Balamban town with 192 dengue fever cases and 1 death, and Liloan town with 162 dengue fever cases and two deaths.\nBogo only had 92 dengue fever cases but 4 people already died from the fever, making it the town with the highest number of casualties in the province.\nHealth education and promotion officer Wilfredo Salgado Jr said that most of the victims in the province are children.\n“The immune system of children are not as strong compared to adults. Most of the kids still can't communicate what problems they have, unlike adults who can easily verbalize what they are feeling,“ Salgado said.\nDr Wilson Anthony Egos, medical officer for communicable and non-communicable diseases, said that the government is focusing on prevention and control of dengue.\n“It's still being worked on in coordination with the national government. We are planning to have a mass immunization of dengue vaccine in schools here,“ Egos said.\nEgos advised the public to practice the 4S to prevent dengue – search and destroy, self-protection measures, see early consultation, and say yes to misting.\nAside from dengue, the PHO also released a public advisory on diarrhea and cholera, which are also common diseases during the rainy season.\nThe PHO encouraged the public to be conscious of their hygiene, observe proper hand washing, and proper food handling. The office also advised Cebuanos to boil their drinking water if their sources are unfiltered to kill harmful bacteria and prevent diseases.",

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines - A total of 46,651 people have been sick with dengue this year, and the death toll -- 294 -- is raising concerns among health authorities. Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag told reporters that the total number of cases from January to July this year is 13.8% higher than the 40,975 recorded during the same period in 2011. Death toll last year was 259. “The DOH is really really concerned now because of the increasing number of deaths,“ he said.  Tayag warned that all the 4 dengue strains -- serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 -- have been observed in the dengue cases this year. Thus it's possible that this year's death toll will surpass the number in 2011, because people who got afflicted with one particular strain could fall ill from another strain, according to Tayag. A total of 23.1% of the cases this year were recorded in Metro Manila, followed by Central Luzon (15.6%) and Calabarzon (13.3%). The DOH stressed that not all dengue victims need to be hospitalized. Tayag said the department wants to make sure doctors are not doing an “over-diagnosis,“ saying some cases can be treated with intravenous fluids.",

The DOH warned that the following areas could be dengue hotspots, based on the agency's records: Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City Barangay Pinagbuhatan, Pasig City Barangay Tañong, Malabon City Barangay 176, Caloocan City Dengue hotspots like these have seen an increase in dengue cases in two weeks' time, explained Dr Manuel Mapue, the DOH's Metro Manila regional medical dengue coordinator. Meanwhile, more barangays have experienced a clustering of dengue cases, which means 3 or 4 dengue cases in an area within 4 weeks, according to Mapue. The barangays with a clustering of dengue cases could be found in the following localities: Manila (1); Caloocan City (1); Las Piñas City (1); Malabon City (4); Parañaque City (3); Pasay City (2); Pasig City (3); Taguig City (2); Valenzuela City (5); Quezon City (13) DOH data show 30 have so far died of dengue this year. From Jan 1 to June 2, Metro Manila had 7,396 dengue cases.

    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – Can the Philippines eliminate measles in 3 years' time? The Department of Health (DOH) said there is enough time as it prepares for a nationwide vaccination September this year. This is the long-term solution of the department for its target of a measles-free nation by 2017. “Isa tayo sa pinakaunang bansa na nag-target sa measles elimination (We're one of the first countries to target measles elimination),” Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said in a forum Tuesday, January 7. He said being measles-free means that in a population of 100 million, the laboratory-confirmed cases should not exceed 100 people. Last year, the confirmed cases numbered 1,724. The Philippine population is 92.34 million based on the 2010 census, but the Commission on Population expected the number to reach 97.7 milllion by 2013. (READ: DOH steps up drive vs measles amid outbreak) Tayag said the mass immunization will be conducted for the whole month of September, targeting 13 million children nationwide. Measles is a viral, highly-contagious respiratory disease. Infected persons exhibit symptoms such as high fever, red eyes, runny nose and cough. Rashes appear throughout the body after two days. The illness can be spread through cough or direct contact with body secretions of an infected person. A person with measles can pass the disease on to 18 other people. Role of LGUs Tayag urged parents in areas with a measles outbreak to have their children vaccinated regardless of whether they were already vaccinated or not. Some 21 barangays in 9 cities have declared an outbreak in their areas, according to state-run Philippine News Agency. These barangays include: Caloocan City: Bagong Barrio and Dagat-dagatan Las Piñas City: Pamplona Uno, Talon Dos, and Talon Singko Malabon City: Longos and Tonsuya Manila: Binondo, Quiapo, Port Area, Sampaloc, Sta. Cruz, Sta. Mesa, and Tondo Muntinlupa City: Alabang and Putatan Navotas: North Bay Boulevard South Parañaque City: Don Bosco and Moonwalk Taguig City: Bagong Tanyag Valenzuela City: Ugong Tayag said it takes the department two weeks to get confirmation, but at the local government level, a suspected case already prompts an investigation. Valenzuela Rep Sherwin Gatchalian told the department that LGUs can play a big role in preventing the upsurge of measles cases in the National Capital Region through information and mass vaccination. (READ: DOH: Measles upsurge due to kids missing free vaccination) “We cannot rely on national government all the time since things like these are best managed at the local level...I’m appealing to the DOH to immediately convene a health summit to review the level of preparedness of LGUs and at the same time set a standard ‘emergency response template’ should there be any outbreak,“ he added. Health Secretary Enrique Ona said a measles outbreak mean “there have been cases of a disease – either suspected or confirmed – in a community or a locality where in the past there was none.“ For Tayag, it means any barangay or district with at least one laboratory-confirmed case. “Lahat ng baby starting 6 months hanggang 59 months bibigyan ng bakuna regardless kung nagkatigdas na o tumanggap na ng bakuna – maliban na lang kung less than a month lang yung bakuna,” he added. (All babies starting 6 months until 59 months will be vaccinated regardless of whether they already had measles or they were already vaccinated – unless the vaccination was administered less than a month ago.) No overdose But the vaccination of children aged 6 months old is only recommended for places with an outbreak. This is 3 months earlier than the prescribed age for the first vaccine (9 to 11 months) which they should still get, as well as the booster shot at 15 months old. The first vaccine is 90% effective, while the booster is 100% effective, Tayag said. “Between isang bakuna at wala, lamang ang isang bakuna. Kaya kahit alam namin na baka di siya maproteksyunan...yung may bakuna, lamang na lamang dun sa 'di nakatanggap ng bakuna. Subali't alam namin na 'di sapat yun kaya kailangan ulitin sa tamang panahon,” he added. (It's better to be vaccinated than not. So even though we know the child may not be protected...the vaccinated child has an advantage compared to the one not vaccinated. But we know that is not enough so the vaccine should be given again at the right time.) In normal conditions, 6 months old is too early for a measles vaccination because maternal antibodies still persist in the baby, rendering the vaccine useless. But during outbreaks, the vaccine is given at 6 months old because, as Tayag said, “nagbabakasakali ka na wala na yung antibodies at kakagat na yung bakuna.” (You're hoping there are no more antibodies and the vaccine will take effect.) Dr Beatriz Quiambao, president of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines, told parents not to worry, as there is no such thing as an overdose when getting more than the prescribed number of vaccines. Tayag again urged parents to avail of the free vaccines, which he said, is the only prevention against measles. And while it is possible to prevent complications, he said people die of measles mainly because they are malnourished or brought to the hospital too late. Last year, the department recorded 21 deaths due to measles.",

    "timestamp": "4:30 PM, September 18, 2014",
    "content": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ 2014 measles outbreak – the worst since 2010 – has “exported” the highly contagious disease to other countries, a Department of Health (DOH) official said on Wednesday, August 27. “Philippines became the amplifier of measles infection to other countries. Nage-export na tayo ng (We already export) measle cases, importations to other countries like US, Japan, Australia, Singapore,” Dulce Elfa of the health department’s Family Health Office said at a seminar. For 2014 alone, the DOH already recorded 6,287 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles. Elfa said the top 3 regions with the most measle cases are the National Capital Region, Calabarzon and Central Luzon. Most of the cases are unvaccinated children under two years of age. Measles is a viral, highly-contagious respiratory disease. Infected persons exhibit symptoms such as high fever, red eyes, runny nose, and cough. Rashes appear throughout the body after two days. The illness can be spread through cough or direct contact with body secretions of an infected person. A person with measles can pass the disease on to 18 other people. Factors Elfa enumerated 6 main reasons for the outbreak: Variation in subnational coverage for the 1st dose measles vaccination Slow uptake for the MCV2 Large birth cohort of 2.7 million leads to quick accumulation of susceptibles and densely populated in many areas Immunization coverage in 2011 campaign was not high and uniform from area to area Series of major disasters from December 2012 to end of 2013 affected some regions, with significant damage to general infrastructure, health facilities, staff capacities and service implementation Widespread domestic population movements further aggravated by disasters Data from the National Epidemiology Center showed that in 2013, there was a large drop in the percentage of children who completed their two vaccines for protection from measles. From the 91% of children who were administered their first vaccine, only 55% came back for their second vaccine. (READ: DOH: Measles upsurge due to kids missing free vaccination) The health department prescribes that children should get their first measles vaccine at 9 to 11 months old, and their booster shot at 15 months old. As Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag earlier said, the first vaccine is 90% effective, while the booster is 100% effective. As of July 5, the country’s measles incidence rate is at 162 people for every population of 1 million. There are also 16,214 confirmed cases of measles, which include both laboratory-confirmed cases and epidemiologically-linked ones. “Halos lahat ng regions may outbreak na ng measles (Almost all regions already have an outbreak),” Elfa noted. Health Secretary Enrique Ona earlier explained that a measles outbreak means “there have been cases of a disease – either suspected or confirmed – in a community or a locality where in the past there was none.“ There is also a high number of confirmed cases among children below 9 months old who are not yet eligible for vaccination. DOH is set to conduct a month-long nationwide vaccination in September to interrupt the transmission of measles and rubella, and to protect Filipinos from the consequences of importation of wild poliovirus. The department’s strategy will be to reach every purok (area) and achieve over 95% coverage. Health service delivery will also be re-established in disaster-hit areas. “Before the year ends sana makita natin drop [in] cases (Before the year ends we hope to see a drop [in] cases),“ Elfa said.",
